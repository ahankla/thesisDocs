abstract = {Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which sufficient extra heating is provided in radiation-dominated accretion flows. We consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to the viscosity and the energy transported by a saturated form of thermal conduction are balanced by the advection cooling. For the steady-state structure of such accretion flows a set of self-similar solution are presented. Based on these solutions while the radial and the rotational velocities are both sub-Keplerian, increasing the level of thermal conduction has the effects of decreasing the rotational velocity, but increasing the radial velocity. Conduction provides extra heating and the temperature of the gas increases with thermal conduction.},

abstract = {The stability of a collisionless, magnetised plasma to local convective disturbances is examined, with a focus on kinetic and finite-Larmor-radius effects. Specific application is made to the outskirts of galaxy clusters, which contain hot and tenuous plasma whose temperature increases in the direction of gravity. At long wavelengths (the 'drift-kinetic' limit), we obtain the kinetic version of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and its Alfv{\'{e}}nic counterpart (Alfv{\'{e}}nic MTI), which were previously discovered and analysed using a magnetofluid (i.e. Braginskii) description. At sub-ion-Larmor scales, we discover an overstability driven by the electron-temperature gradient of kinetic-Alfv{\'{e}}n drift waves – the electron MTI (eMTI) – whose growth rate is even larger than the standard MTI. At intermediate scales, we find that ion finite-Larmor-radius effects tend to stabilise the plasma. We discuss the physical interpretation of these instabilities in detail, and compare them both with previous work on magnetised convection in a collisional plasma and with temperature-gradient-driven drift-wave instabilities well known to the magnetic-confinement-fusion community. The implications of having both fluid and kinetic scales simultaneously driven unstable by the same temperature gradient are briefly discussed.},

@article{12015,
abstract = {We describe a set of simulations of supercritical accretion on to a non-rotating supermassive black hole (BH). The accretion flow takes the form of a geometrically thick disc with twin low-density funnels around the rotation axis. For accretion rates ˙ M Edd , there is sufficient gas in the funnel to make this region optically thick. Radiation from the disc first flows into the funnel, after which it accelerates the optically thick funnel gas along the axis. The resulting jet is baryon loaded and has a terminal density-weighted velocity ≈0.3c. Much of the radiative luminosity is converted into kinetic energy by the time the escaping gas becomes optically thin. These jets are not powered by BHrotation or magnetic driving, but purely by radiation. Their characteristic beaming angle is ∼0.2 rad. For an observer viewing down the axis, the isotropic equivalent luminosity of total energy is as much as 10 48 erg s −1 for a 10 7 M BH accreting at 10 3 Eddington. Therefore, energetically, the simulated jets are consistent with observations of the most powerful tidal disruption events, e.g. Swift J1644. The jet velocity is, however, too low to match the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ {\textgreater} 2 inferred in J1644. There is no such conflict in the case of other tidal disruption events. Since favourably oriented observers see isotropic equivalent luminosities that are highly super-Eddington, the simulated models can explain observations of ultraluminous X-ray sources, at least in terms of luminosity and energetics, without requiring intermediate-mass BHs.},

abstract = {We carried out three-dimensional global resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability in optically thin hot black hole accretion flows by assuming bremsstrahlung cooling. General relativistic effects are simulated by using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. Cooling instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes sufficiently large. We found that as the instability grows the accretion flow changes from an optically thin, hot, gas pressure-supported state (low/hard state) to a cooler, magnetically supported, quasi-steady state. During this transition, magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure because the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the toroidal magnetic flux. Since further vertical contraction of the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically supported disk, the heating rate balances with the radiative cooling rate. The magnetically supported disk exists for time scale much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to the accretion time scale. We examined the stability of the magnetically supported disk analytically, assuming that the toroidal magnetic flux is conserved, and found it thermally and secularly stable. Our findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous, X-ray hard state even when their luminosity exceeds the threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.},

This amount of energy is ultimately distributed between outflow and radiation, the latter scaling weakly with the accretion rate for super-critical accretion rates, and returned to the interstellar medium.

abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*, the ultralow-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet, wind, and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution of the host galaxy.},

@article{Balbus2000a,
abstract = {The stratiÐcation of entropy and the stratiÐcation of angular momentum are closely analogous. The analogy has been developed for a number of di erent problems in the {\~{N}}uid literature, but its conse-quences for the behavior of turbulent accretion disks are less appreciated. Of particular interest is the behavior of disks in which angular momentum transport is controlled by convection, and heat transport by dynamical turbulence. In both instances we argue that the transport must proceed " " backward {\"{I}}{\"{I}} rela-tive to the sense one would expect from a simple enhanced di usion approach. Reversed angular momentum transport has already been seen in numerical simulations ; contragradient thermal di usion should be amenable to numerical veriÐcation as well. These arguments also bear on the observed nonlin-ear local stability of isolated Keplerian disks : locally generated turbulence in such a disk would require simultaneous inward and outward angular momentum transport, which is, of course, impossible. We also describe a di usive instability that is the entropy analogue to the magnetorotational instability. It a ects thermally stratiÐed layers when Coulomb conduction and a weak magnetic Ðeld are present. The plasma must be sufficiently dilute that heat is channeled only along Ðeld lines. The criterion for convective insta-bility goes from one of upwardly decreasing entropy to one of upwardly decreasing temperature. The instability remains formally viable if radiative heat transport is also present, but the equilibrium is much more unstable if Coulomb transport is dominant. In that case, the maximum growth rate is of the order of the inverse sound crossing time, independent of the thermal conductivity. The indi erence of the growth rate to the conduction coefficient, its simple dynamical scaling, and the replacement in the stabil-ity criterion of a conserved quantity (entropy) gradient by a free energy (temperature) gradient are properties similar to those exhibited by the magnetorotational instability. Subject headings : accretion, accretion disks {\`{E}} convection {\`{E}} hydrodynamics {\`{E}} instabilities {\`{E}} turbulence 1. INTRODUCTION Although one normally associates the turbulent trans-port of heat with thermal convection and the turbulent transport of (angular) momentum with shear instabilities, they are sometimes called upon to interchange roles. In the study of accretion disks, for example, two related problems arise : does convective turbulence act like an enhanced vis-cosity, and does MHD turbulence act like an enhanced thermal di usivity ? In what sense is turbulence compelled by irreversible thermodynamics to transport from hot to cold and from fast to slow ? In the course of this paper, we will see that great care is needed when trying to answer such questions and that nothing can be taken for granted. We shall make frequent use of a very deep analogy between angular momentum and entropy stratiÐcation. The analogy is well known in the {\~{N}}uid community but seems less appreciated by disk theorists. An extensive review and applications to speciÐc two-dimensional {\~{N}}ows may be found in the article by Veronis (1970), who credits the orig-inal insight for the analogy to Lord Rayleigh, and there are briefer discussions in the texts by Greenspan (1968) and Tritton (1988). Our purpose here to show that the angular momentum{\`{E}} entropy correspondence is a powerful conceptual tool for understanding aspects of turbulent transport and {\~{N}}ow sta-bility. Even in circumstances in which the analogy is not a mathematical identity, it a ords physical insights. For example, the magnetorotational instability is a destabilizing process in which a magnetic Ðeld taps into the angular velocity gradient, a source of free energy, in the presence of an otherwise stabilizing angular momentum gradient. Might there be a related analogue instability, which taps into a thermal gradient, also a free energy source, in the presence of an otherwise stabilizing entropy gradient ? The answer, we shall see, turns out to be yes. Our understanding of the large-scale properties of accre-tion disk turbulence also is sharpened by seeking analogous dynamical and thermal behavior. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of convective instability have consis-tently yielded inward angular momentum transport (Stone {\&} Balbus 1996 ; Cabot 1996), opposite to the sense one would expect if the turbulence behaved as an enhanced viscosity. We shall argue that vertical turbulent heat trans-port in an accretion disk must also behave in the same contrary fashion : the dynamical agitation of a convectively stable layer will drive heat from the cooler upper layers to the hotter midplane layers. This paper is organized as follows. In ° 2, we present a simple physical picture for inward angular momentum transport in convectively unstable disks and suggest a reason for why pressure gradients are ine ective for causing outward transport. Section 3 presents the analogous story for downward heat transport in a convectively stable verti-cal layer. (In this case, of course, pressure gradients are irrelevant.) Section 4 presents the temperature gradient ana-logue of the magnetorotational instability, discussing both its power and its limitations and describing its physical basis. Finally, ° 5 summarizes our Ðndings.},

abstract = {Accretion onto a supermassive black hole of a rotating inflow is a particularly difficult problem to study because of the wide range of length scales involved. There have been broadly utilized analytic and numerical treatments of the global properties of accretion flows, but detailed numerical simulations are required to address certain critical aspects. We use the ZEUS code to run hydrodynamical simulations of rotating, axisymmetric accretion flows with Bremsstrahlung cooling, considering solutions for which the centrifugal balance radius significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, with and without viscous angular momentum transport. Infalling gas is followed from well beyond the Bondi radius down to the vicinity of the black hole. We produce a continuum of solutions with respect to the single parameter ˙ M B / ˙ M Edd , and there is a sharp transition between two general classes of solutions at an Eddington ratio of ˙ M B / ˙ M Edd ∼ few × 10 −2 . Our high inflow solutions are very similar to the standard Shakura {\&} Sunyaev results. But our low inflow results are to zeroth order the stationary Papaloizou {\&} Pringle solution, which has no accretion. To next order in the small, assumed viscosity they show circulation, with disk and conical wind outflows almost balancing inflow. These solutions are characterized by hot, vertically extended disks, and net accretion proceeds at an extremely low rate, only of order $\alpha$ times the inflow rate. Our simulations have converged with respect to spatial resolution and temporal duration, and they do not depend strongly on our choice of boundary conditions.},

With the critical power of self-focusing scaling as the laser wavelength squared, the quest for longer-wavelength drivers, which would radically increase the peak power and, hence, the laser energy in a single filament, has been ongoing over two decades, during which time the available laser sources limited filamentation experiments in the atmosphere to the near-infrared and visible ranges. Here, we demonstrate filamentation of ultrashort mid-infrared pulses in the atmosphere for the first time. We show that, with the spectrum of a femtosecond laser driver centered at 3.9 $\mu$m, right at the edge of the atmospheric transmission window, radiation energies above 20 mJ and peak powers in excess of 200 GW can be transmitted through the atmosphere in a single filament. Our studies reveal unique properties of mid-infrared filaments, where the generation of powerful mid-infrared supercontinuum is accompanied by unusual scenarios of optical harmonic generation, giving rise to remarkably broad radiation spectra, stretching from the visible to the mid-infrared.},

abstract = {Self-compression of multi-millijoule laser pulses during filamentary propagation is usually explained by the interplay of self-focusing and defocusing effects, causing a substantial concentration of energy on the axis of the propagating optical pulse. Recently, it has been argued that cell windows may play a decisive role in the self-compression mechanism. As such windows have to be used for media other than air their presence is often unavoidable, yet they present a sudden nonadiabatic change in dispersion and nonlinearity that should lead to a destruction of the temporal and spatial integrity of the light bullets generated in the self-compression mechanism. We now experimentally prove that there is, in fact, a self-healing mechanism that helps to overcome the potentially destructive consequences of the cell windows. We show in two carefully conducted experiments that the cell window position decisively influences activation or inhibition of the self-healing mechanism. A comparison with a windowless cell shows that the presence of this mechanism is an important prerequisite for the exploitation of self-compression effects in windowed cells filled with inert gases.},

abstract = {The propagation of short, intense laser pulses in the atmosphere is investigated theoretically and numerically. A set of three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear propagation equations is derived, which includes the effects of dispersion, nonlinear self-focusing, stimulated molecular Raman scattering, multiphoton and tunneling ionization, energy depletion due to ionization, relativistic focusing, and ponderomotively excited plasma wakefields. The instantaneous frequency spread along a laser pulse in air, which develops due to various nonlinear effects, is analyzed and discussed. Coupled equations for the power, spot size, and electron density are derived for an intense ionizing laser pulse. From these equations we obtain an equilibrium for a single optical-plasma filament, which involves a balancing between diffraction, nonlinear self-focusing, and plasma defocusing. The equilibrium is shown to require a specific distribution of power along the filament. It is found that in the presence of ionization a self-guided optical filament is not realizable. A method for generating a remote spark in the atmosphere is proposed, which utilizes the dispersive and nonlinear properties of air to cause a low-intensity chirped laser pulse to compress both longitudinally and transversely. For optimally chosen parameters, we find that the transverse and longitudinal focal lengths can be made to coincide, resulting in rapid intensity increase, ionization, and white light generation in a localized region far from the source. Coupled equations for the laser spot size and pulse duration are derived, which can describe the focusing and compression process in the low-intensity regime. More general examples involving beam focusing, compression, ionization, and white light generation near the focal region are studied by numerically solving the full set of 3D, nonlinear propagation equations.},

abstract = {When a powerful femtosecond laser pulse propagates in an optical medium, self-focusing occurs.

The series of self-foci from different slices of the front part of the pulse give rise to the perception of a so-called filament. The back part of the pulse undergoes self-phase modulation and self-steepening resulting in a strong spectral broadening. The final pulse is a white-light laser pulse (supercontinuum).

The study is undertaken using an advanced nonlinear pulse propagation model based on a multimode generalized nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation that has been modified to include plasma effects. Plasma defocusing and linear propagation effects are shown to be the dominant processes within a highly dynamical mechanism that enables 100-fs pulses to be compressed into the few-cycle regime after {\textless}50 mm of propagation. Once the mechanism has been introduced, parameter spaces are explored and compressor designs suitable for performing high-field experiments in situ are presented.We finish by showing howthese designs may be extended to novelwavelengths and driving pulses delivered by state-of-the-art high-repetition-rate lasers.},

abstract = {s Abstract Magnetic fields in the intercluster medium have been measured using a variety of techniques, including studies of synchrotron relic and halo radio sources within clusters, studies of inverse Compton X-ray emission from clusters, surveys of Faraday rotation measures of polarized radio sources both within and behind clusters, and studies of cluster cold fronts in X-ray images. These measurements imply that most cluster atmospheres are substantially magnetized, with typical field strengths of order 1 µGauss with high areal filling factors out to Mpc radii. There is likely to be considerable variation in field strengths and topologies both within and between clusters, especially when comparing dynamically relaxed clusters to those that have recently undergone a merger. In some locations, such as the cores of cooling flow clusters, the magnetic fields reach levels of 10–40 µG and may be dynamically important. In all clusters the magnetic fields have a significant effect on energy transport in the intracluster medium. We also review current theories on the origin of cluster magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Context. Accretion onto galactic and supermassive black holes occurs in different modes, which are documented in hard and soft spectral states, commonly attributed to an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) inside a truncated disk and standard disk accretion, respectively. At the times of spectral transition an intermediate state is observed, for which the accretion flow pattern is still unclear. Aims. We analyze the geometry of the accretion flow when the mass flow rate in the disk decreases (soft/hard transition) and evapo-ration of gas into the coronal flow leads to disk truncation. Methods. We evaluate the physics of an advection-dominated flow affected by thermal conduction to a cool accretion disk underneath. Results. We find re-condensation of gas from the ADAF into the underlying inner disk at distances from the black hole and at rates, that depend on the properties of the hot ADAF and vary with the mass accretion rate. This sustains an inner disk for longer than a viscous decay time after the spectral transition occurred, in accordance with the spectra that indicate cool gas in the neighborhood of the accreting black hole. The model allows us to understand why Cyg X-1 does not show hysteresis in the spectral state transition luminosity that is commonly observed for X-ray transient sources. Conclusions. Our results shed new light on the complex mass flow pattern during spectral state transition.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics behind black hole state transitions and the changes they reflect in outbursts has become long-standing problem. The X-ray reflection spectrum describes the interaction between the hard X-ray source (the power-law continuum) and the cool accretion disc it illuminates, and thus permits an indirect view of how the two evolve. We present a systematic analysis of the reflection spectrum throughout three outbursts (500+ observations) of the black hole binary GX 339−4, representing the largest study applying a self-consistent treatment of reflection to date. Particular attention is paid to the coincident evolution of the power law and reflection, which can be used to determine the accretion geometry. The hard state is found to be distinctly reflection weak; however, the ratio of reflection to power law gradually increases as the source luminosity rises. In contrast, the reflection is found to dominate the power law throughout most of the soft state, with increasing supremacy as the source decays. We discuss potential dynamics driving this, favouring inner disc truncation and decreasing coronal height for the hard and soft states, respectively. Evolution of the ionization parameter, power-law slope and high-energy cut-off also agree with this interpretation.},

abstract = {In many magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction occurs almost exclusively parallel to magnetic field lines. In this case, the usual stability criterion for convective stability, the Schwarzschild criterion, which depends on entropy gradients, is modified. In the magnetized long mean free path regime, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln T/dz) {\textgreater} 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective-type instability that results as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron heat conduction to numerically simulate the linear growth and nonlinear saturation of the MTI in plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent agreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition of isotropic conduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic fields can damp the growth of the MTI and affect the nonlinear regime. The instability saturates when the atmosphere becomes isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By maintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries of the simulation domain, sustained convective turbulence can be driven. MTI-stable layers introduced by isotropic conduction are used to prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. We find that the largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions as opposed to the actual thermal conduction itself. Finally, we explore the implications of this instability for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as neutron stars, the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.},

@article{Stone1996,
abstract = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (Balbus {\&} Hawley 1991) in an initially isothermal, vertically stratified accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk, but are global in the vertical direction in the sense that the computational domain encompasses several scale heights. We find that the instability generates and maintains magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stratified disks. The properties of the saturated, turbulent state are similar to those reported for nonstratified homogeneous boxes, e.g., the power-law spectral distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov. The angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the magnetic pressure; if the average rate is scaled to the equatorial pressure, as in a standard ''alpha-disk'' model, the constant of proportionality is alpha less than or similar to 0.01 for most of our simulations. This value may be limited somewhat by the numerical resolution of our simulations. We find buoyancy does not play an important role as a saturation mechanism. The nonlinear evolution of disks that begin with a variety of initial magnetic field geometries and strengths is similar. In particular, models in which the most unstable wavelengths are initially well resolved saturate at and maintain roughly the same magnetic energy density, suggesting dynamo action in the disk.We use the simulations to study the effect of the instability on the vertical structure of magnetic accretion disks. After saturation, the disk consists of a weakly magnetized core surrounded by a strongly magnetized corona. Changing the vertical boundary conditions does not significantly alter this structure. The vertical flux of magnetic energy is small compared to the local magnetic energy generation and dissipation rates; The disk is stable to Parker and buoyancy modes. Models evolved with an adiabatic equation of state undergo substantial heating due to nonlinear dissipation, resulting in an increase in the scale height of the disk. The vertical structure produced by the instability, particularly the presence of a strongly magnetized corona, may have relevance to the production of MHD winds from disks.},

abstract = {We describe local shearing box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a collisionless plasma. Collisionless effects may be important in radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as near the black hole in the Galactic center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modified to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A fluid closure approximation is used to calculate heat conduction along magnetic field lines. The anisotropic pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular momentum in accretion flows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses). We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ''collision'' rate in a collisionless plasma and lead to more MHD-like dynamics. We find that the MRI leads to efficient growth of the magnetic field in a collisionless plasma, with saturation amplitudes comparable to those in MHD. In the saturated state, the anisotropic stress is comparable to the Maxwell stress, implying that the rate of angular momentum transport may be moderately enhanced in a collision-less plasma.},

We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

abstract = {Recent millimeter-VLBI observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) have, for the first time, directly probed distances comparable to the horizon scale of a black hole. This provides unprecedented access to the environment immediately around the horizon of an accreting black hole. We leverage both existing spectral and polarization measurements and our present understanding of accretion theory to produce a suite of generic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models of Sgr A*, which we then fit to these recent millimeter-VLBI observations. We find that if the accretion flow onto Sgr A* is well described by an RIAF model, the orientation and magnitude of the black hole's spin are constrained to a two-dimensional surface in the spin, inclination, position angle parameter space. For each of these, we find the likeliest values and their 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ errors to be a = 0 +0.4+0.7 , $\theta$ = 50 • +10 • +30 • −10 • −10 • , and $\xi$ = −20 • +31 • +107 • −16 • −29 • , when the resulting probability distribution is marginalized over the others. The most probable combination is a = 0 +0.2+0.4 , $\theta$ = 90 • −40 • −50 • , and $\xi$ = −14 • +7 • +11 • −7 • −11 • , though the uncertainties on these are very strongly correlated, and high probability configurations exist for a variety of inclination angles above 30 • and spins below 0.99. Nevertheless, this demonstrates the ability millimeter-VLBI observations, even with only a few stations, to significantly constrain the properties of Sgr A*.},

By performing local two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of disks, we demonstrate that convective motions can release heat sufficiently rapidly as to substantially alter the vertical structure of the disks. If the dissipation rate within a vertical column is proportional to its mass, the disk settles into a new conÐguration that is thinner than the standard radiation-supported equilibrium by a factor of 2. If, on the other hand, the vertically integrated dissipation rate is proportional to the vertically integrated total pressure, the disk is subject to the well-known thermal instability. Convection, however, biases the development of this instability toward col-lapse. The end result of such a collapse is a gas-pressure{\`{E}}dominated equilibrium at the original column density.},

abstract = {We study the effects of optically thin radiative cooling on the structure of radiatively inef-ficient accretion flows (RIAFs). The flow structure is geometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the cooling time is longer than the viscous time-scale (i.e. t cool t visc). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete and forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura–Sunyaev disc. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner hot flow and an outer thin disc. For a short cooling time the accretion flow separates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a cold thin disc. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot corona corresponding to a critical value of t cool /t ff (∼ 10–100), the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our simulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a cold blackbody-dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion rate. The transition from a thin disc to a RIAF happens because of mass exhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time becomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous time-scale for a geometrically thin disc is quite long, the high-soft state is expected to be long-lived. The different time-scales in black hole transients correspond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling and free fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state transitions in XRBs.},

For a decreasing field, it is found that mostly oblique firehose fluctuations grow at ion Larmor scales and saturate with energies ∝S 1=2 ; the pressure anisotropy is pinned at the stability threshold by particle scattering off microscale fluctuations. In contrast, nonlinear mirror fluctuations are large compared to the ion Larmor scale and grow secularly in time; marginality is maintained by an increasing population of resonant particles trapped in magnetic mirrors. After one shear time, saturated order-unity magnetic mirrors are formed and particles scatter off their sharp edges. Both instabilities drive sub-ion-Larmor–scale fluctuations, which appear to be kinetic-Alfv{\'{e}}n-wave turbulence. Our results impact theories of momentum and heat transport in astrophysical and space plasmas, in which the stretching of a magnetic field by shear is a generic process.},

abstract = {We describe the implementation of the shearing box approximation for the study of the dynamics of accretion disks in the Athena magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. Second-order Crank–Nicholson time differencing is used for the Coriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equation for accuracy and stability. We show that this approach conserves energy for epicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. In the energy equation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an effective potential in a way that guarantees that total energy (including the gravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. We introduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport to preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This algorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes the truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the shearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary to conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle, similar corrections are also required to conserve mass, momentum, and energy; however in practice we find that the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than 0.03{\%} over hundreds of orbits. The algorithms have been applied to studies of the nonlinear regime of the MRI in very wide (up to 32 scale heights) horizontal domains.},

Many such plasmas are also magnetized, in the sense that the thermal Larmor radius is smaller than gradient scale lengths. Rela-tivistic MHD, conventionally used to describe such systems, requires the collision time to be shorter than any other timescale in the system. On this assumption, it uses the thermodynamic equilibrium form of the plasma pressure tensor, neglecting stress anisotropy as well as heat {\~{N}}ow along the magnetic Ðeld. Beginning with exact moments of the kinetic equation, we derive a closed set of Lorentz-covariant {\~{N}}uid equations that allows for anisotropy and heat {\~{N}}ow, as would pertain to a collisionless plasma, far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The heart of the derivation is the construction of the plasma stress tensor as the fully general solution to the energy-momentum conservation law in the case of dominant electro-magnetic force.},

Eventually the accretion geometry transforms to a disc-corona configuration. In summary our results are consistent with the truncated accretion scenario for the state transition.},

However, in the presence of hydrodynamic convection, field reversals no longer occur. Instead, the azimuthal field strength fluctuates quasi-periodically while maintaining the same polarity, which can either be symmetric or antisymmetric about the disc midplane. Using data from the simulations of Hirose et al. (2014), we demonstrate that the lack of field reversals in the presence of convection is due to hydrodynamic mixing of magnetic field from the more strongly magnetized upper layers into the midplane, which then annihilate field reversals that are starting there. Our convective simulations differ in several respects from those reported in previous work by others, in which stronger magnetization likely plays a more important role than convection.},

Understanding this nonlinear system is complicated by the dynamical effects of velocity shear between fast and slow solar wind streams, by the spherical expan­ sion of the solar wind, and by its compressibility. Direct spacecraft observations from 0.3 to over 20 AU, radio scintillation observations of plasmas near the Sun, numerical simulations, and various models provide complementary methods that have shown convincingly that the fl uctuations in the wind parameters undergo sig­ nificant dynamical evolution independent of whatever turbulence might exist in the solar photosphere and corona. This rich area of study allows one to test theories of turbulence against direct observation, and to use observations to guide and mo­ tivate development of turbulence theories. The solar wind thus provides an excel­ lent laboratory for studying many fundamental questions about turbulent plasmas.},

abstract = {Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence makes it possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end, we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) code HARM from axisymmetry to full three dimensions. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H/r 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov–Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosity reaching infinity is 6{\%} greater than the Novikov–Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be 20{\%} greater than the Novikov–Thorne value.},

Under these conditions, the thermal conductivity and viscosity of the plasma can be dramatically altered. This alteration allows outwardly decreasing angular velocity or temperature gradients to become strongly destabilizing. This paper generalizes an earlier, simple analysis of the viscosity instability by including the dynamical effects of magnetic field line tension. Such effects lower the growth rates found in the absence of such tension but still allow growth rates in excess of the maximum of the standard magnetorotational instability. We find very good quantitative agreement with more complex kinetic treatments of the same process. The combination of large growth rates and large magnetic Prandtl number suggests that protogalactic disks are powerful dynamos.},

abstract = {I calculate the linear stability of a stratified low collisionality plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Heat is assumed to flow only along magnetic field lines. In the absence of a heat flux in the background plasma, Balbus (2000) demonstrated that plasmas in which the temperature increases in the direction of gravity are buoyantly unstable to convective-like motions (the ``magnetothermal instability''). I show that in the presence of a background heat flux, an analogous instability is present when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity. The instability is driven by the background heat flux and the fastest growing mode has a growth time of order the local dynamical time. Thus, independent of the sign of the temperature gradient, weakly magnetized low collisionality plasmas are unstable on a dynamical time to magnetically-mediated buoyancy instabilities. The instability described in this paper is predicted to be present in clusters of galaxies at radii from {\~{}} 0.1-100 kpc, where the observed temperature increases outwards. Possible consequences for the origin of cluster magnetic fields, ``cooling flows,'' and the thermodynamics of the intercluster medium are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We derive closure relations for a plasma fluid model, issued from the BGK equation for electrons in a strong magnetic field. Our scaling of the BGK equation leads in the asymptotic limit $\epsilon$ → 0 towards the adiabatic electron regime, where $\epsilon$ embodies the scaled Larmor radius as well as a low Mach number. In this regime the electron density adjusts instantaneously to perturbations of the electric potential via a Boltzmann relation, i.e., n = ce $\phi$/T . The fluid closures are obtained in the small-$\epsilon$ regime from a Hilbert ansatz of the distribution function; the ensuing hierarchy of kinetic equations is solved exactly up to the desired order. Different closures emerge depending on the importance of the ratio $\nu$/$\omega$c between the electron-electron collision frequency $\nu$ and the cyclotron frequency $\omega$c. Anisotropy in the transport coefficients is found when $\nu$/$\omega$c 1. Moreover, bringing into play the obtained closures, we present a drift-fluid model valid for $\epsilon$ 1 and identify the correct limit model as $\epsilon$ → 0. The limit model can be used to avoid the crude approximations c = const. and T = const. in the electron Boltzmann relation, frequently used for plasma simulations.},

abstract = {We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet. Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as higher frequencies (including quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs) in the power spectra, and a faster jet. The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative (and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard soft spectral transition seen in black holes. The neutron stars are also consistent with the same models, but with an additional component due to their surface, giving implicit evidence for the event horizon in black holes. We review claims of observational data which conflict with this picture, but show that these can also be consistent with the truncated disc model. We also review suggested alternative models for the accretion flow which do not involve a truncated disc. The most successful of these converge on a similar geometry, where there is a transition at some radius larger than the last stable orbit between a standard disc and an inner, jet dominated region, with the X-ray source associated with a mildly relativistic outflow, beamed away from the disc. However, the observed uniformity of properties between black holes at different inclinations suggests that even weak beaming of the X-ray emission may be constrained by the data. After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the black hole spin. By contrast, these systems can also show very different spectra at these high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum (and probably structure) is strongly distorted by Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity, though there is growing evidence that winds may play an important role. We stress that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert 1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.},

abstract = {Local (shearing box) simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angular momentum transport by pressure anisotropy (p ? 6 ¼ p k , where the directions are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparable to that due to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses. Pressure anisotropy, which is effectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariants related to p ? and p k in a fluctuating magnetic field. In a collisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus the viscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency. Our simulations show that {\$}50{\%} of the gravitational potential energy is directly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (the remaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy). We show that electrons receive a significant fraction [{\$}(T e /T i) 1 = 2 ] of this dissipated energy. Employing this heating by an anisotropic viscous stress in one-dimensional models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greater than 0.5{\%} for ˙ M k10 {\`{A}}4 ˙ M Edd . Thus, a low accretion rate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain the low luminosity of many accreting black holes. For Sgr A {\~{A}} in the Galactic center, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of {\%}3 ; 10 {\`{A}}8 M yr {\`{A}}1 and an electron temperature of {\%}3 ; 10 10 K at {\%}10 Schwarzschild radii; the latter is consistent with the brightness temperature inferred from VLBI observations.},

abstract = {We present a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) three-dimensional simulation of a nonradiative accretion flow originating in a pressure-supported torus. The evolution is controlled by the magnetorotational instability, which produces turbulence. The flow forms a nearly Keplerian disk. The total pressure scale height in this disk is comparable to the vertical size of the initial torus. Gas pressure dominates near the equator; magnetic pressure is more important in the surrounding atmosphere. A magnetically dominated bound outflow is driven from the disk. The accretion rate through the disk exceeds the final rate into the hole, and a hot torus forms inside 10r(g). Hot gas, pushed up against the centrifugal barrier and confined by magnetic pressure, is ejected in a narrow, unbound, conical outflow. The dynamics are controlled by magnetic turbulence, not thermal convection, and a hydrodynamic alpha -model is inadequate to describe the flow. The limitations of two-dimensional MHD simulations are also discussed.},

Stability criteria similar in form to the classical H{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}iland inequalities are found, but with angular velocity gradients replacing angular momentum gradients, and temperature gradients replacing entropy gradients. These criteria are indifferent to the properties of the magnetic field and to the magnitude of the thermal conductivity. Angular velocity gradients and temperature gradients are both free energy sources; it is not surprising that they are directly relevant to the stability of the gas. Magnetic fields and thermal conductivity provide the means by which these sources can be tapped. Previous studies have generally been based upon the classical H{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}iland criteria, which are inappropriate for magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas. In sharp contrast to recent claims in the literature, the new stability criteria demonstrate that marginal flow stability is not a fundamental property of accreting plasmas thought to be associated with low luminosity X-ray sources.},

The faint exterior rings (E, G, F and one just identified between the A and F rings) are intimately associated with magnetospheric particles and contain mainly small grains, which are also prominent in the "spokes" located in the dense, middle portion of the B ring.

abstract = {We study radiative properties of hot accretion flows in a general relativistic model with an exact treatment of global Comptonization, developed in our recent works. We note a strong dependence of electron temperature on the strength of magnetic field and we clarify that the underlying mechanism involves the change of the flow structure, with more strongly magne-tized flows approaching the slab geometry more closely. We find that the model with thermal synchrotron radiation being the main source of seed photons agrees with the spectral index versus Eddington ratio relation observed in black hole transients below 1 per cent of the Eddington luminosity, L Edd , and models with a weak direct heating of electrons (small $\delta$) are more consistent with observations. Models with large $\delta$ predict slightly too soft spectra, fur-thermore, they strongly overpredict electron temperatures at ∼0.01L Edd . The low-luminosity spectra, at Edd , deviate from a power-law shape in the soft X-ray range, and we note that the first-scattering bump often resembles a thermal like component, with the tempera-ture of a few hundred eV, superimposed on a power-law spectrum. The model with thermal Comptonization of thermal synchrotron radiation does not agree with well-studied AGNs ob-served below ∼0.01L Edd , for which there is a substantial evidence for the lack of an inner cold disc. This indicates that the model of hot flows powering AGNs should be revised, possibly by taking into account an additional (but internal to the flow) source of seed photons.},

abstract = {Previous works have clearly shown the existence of winds from black hole hot accretion flow and investigated their detailed properties. In extremely low accretion rate systems, the collisional mean-free path of electrons is large compared with the length-scale of the system, thus thermal conduction is dynamically important. When the magnetic field is present, the thermal conduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines. In this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the wind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that thermal conduction has only moderate effects on the mass flux of wind. But the energy flux of wind can be increased by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} due to the increase of wind velocity when thermal conduction is included. The increase of wind velocity is because of the increase of driving forces (e.g. gas pressure gradient force and centrifugal force) when thermal conduction is included. This result demonstrates that thermal conduction plays an important role in determining the properties of wind.},

The experimentally observed periodicity of the multiple filament arrays depends on the input beam intensity and this behavior is reproduced in detail by the numerical simulations.

On propagating further, a quasistable balance is established between self-focusing and defocusing due to ionization-induced nonlinearity and diffraction, causing the beam to propagate in a self-guided mode. Furthermore, it was shown that the front of the split pulse decays faster, while the trailing edge experiences self-focusing and self-defocusing until a self-guided propagation mode is achieved.

We consider models with low accretion rates and calculate the spectra produced by a hybrid electron population consisting of both thermal and nonthermal particles. The thermal electrons produce the submillimeter emission and can account for its linear polarization properties. As noted in previous work, the observed low-frequency radio spectrum can be explained if a small fraction ({\%}1.5{\%}) of the electron thermal energy resides in a soft power-law tail. In the innermost region of the accretion flow, turbulence and/or magnetic reconnection events may occasionally accelerate a fraction of the electrons into a harder power-law tail.

Two main topics merged during this period that support important scienti?c activities: attosecond pulses are now gen- ated in the X-UV spectral domain, and coherent control of chemical events is now possible by tailoring the shape of femtosecond pulses. To update this advanced textbook, it was necessary to introduce these ?elds; two new ch- ters are in this second edition: “Coherent Control in Atoms, Molecules, and Solids”(Chap.11)and“AttosecondPulses”(Chap.12)withwell-documented references. Some changes, addenda, and new references are introduced in the ?rst edition's ten original chapters to take into account new developments and updatethisadvancedtextbookwhichistheresultofascienti?cadventurethat started in 1991. At that time, the French Ministry of Education decided that, in view of the growing importance of ultrashort laser pulses for the national scienti?c community, a Femtosecond Centre should be created in France and devoted to the further education of scientists who use femtosecond pulses as a research tool and who are not specialists in lasers or even in optics.},

Spatiotemporal distortions experienced by a filament formed in an argon cell with subsequent propagation inside the exit glass window and an air path are examined. Millimeter propagation ranges in silica preserve the spatial shape of the filament. However, the pulse duration strongly broadens due to the combination of high dispersion in glass and Kerr nonlinearity. We show that, despite this harmful broadening, on-axis pulse compression can be restored in the final stage of atmospheric propagation and can even be reestablished in vacuum. The key process for refocusing the beam is the introduction of an intensity-dependent spatial curvature in the pulse phase accumulated inside the silica window.},

abstract = {We present a numerical method which evolves a two-temperature, magnetized, radia-tive, accretion flow around a black hole, within the framework of general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics. As implemented in the code KORAL, the gas consists of two sub-components – ions and electrons – which share the same dynamics but experience indepen-dent, relativistically consistent, thermodynamical evolution. The electrons and ions are heated independently according to a standard prescription from the literature for magnetohydrody-namical turbulent dissipation. Energy exchange between the particle species via Coulomb collisions is included. In addition, electrons gain and lose energy and momentum by absorb-ing and emitting synchrotron and bremsstrahlung radiation, and through Compton scatter-ing. All evolution equations are handled within a fully covariant framework in the relativistic fixed-metric spacetime of the black hole. Numerical results are presented for five models of low luminosity black hole accretion. In the case of a model with a mass accretion rate ˙ M ∼ 10 −8 ˙ M Edd , we find that radiation has a negligible effect on either the dynamics or the thermodynamics of the accreting gas. In contrast, a model with a larger ˙ M ∼ 10 −4 ˙ M Edd be-haves very differently, with the gas cooling rapidly and collapsing to a clumpy, optically-thick, disk-like structure. Tests indicate that, even at low accretion rates where radiative cooling is unimportant, it is necessary to treat the thermodynamics of the electrons and ions correctly if one is interested in studying the temperatures of the two species. Using fixed adiabatic indices for the gas and the particle sub-species causes noticeable changes in the results.},

abstract = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g., disk-versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A * are used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

abstract = {Standard models of radiation-supported accretion disks generally assume that diffusive radiation flux is solely responsible for vertical heat transport. This requires that heat must be generated at a critical rate per unit volume if the disk is to be in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. This raises the question of how heat is generated and how energy is transported in MHD turbulence. By analysis of a number of radiation/MHD stratified shearing-box simulations, we show that the divergence of the diffusive radiation flux is indeed capped at the critical rate, but deep inside the disk, substantial vertical energy flux is also carried by advection of radiation. Work done by radiation pressure is a significant part of the energy budget, and much of this work is dissipated later through damping by radiative diffusion. We show how this damping can be measured in the simulations and identify its physical origins. Radiative damping accounts for as much as tens of percent of the total dissipation and is the only realistic physical mechanism for dissipation of turbulence that can actually be resolved in numerical simulations of accretion disks. Buoyancy associated with dynamo-driven, highly magnetized, nearly isobaric nonlinear slow magnetosonic fluctuations is responsible for the radiation advection flux and also explains the persistent periodic magnetic upwelling seen at all values of the radiation to gas pressure ratio. The intimate connection between radiation advection and magnetic buoyancy is the first example we know of in astrophysics in which a dynamo has direct impact on the global energetics of a system.},

abstract = {Aims. We study the influence of the choice of transport coefficients (viscosity and resistivity) on MHD turbulence driven by the mag-netorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks. Methods. We follow the methodology described in Paper I: we adopt an unstratified shearing box model and focus on the case where the net vertical magnetic flux threading the box vanishes. For the most part we use the operator split code ZEUS, including explicit transport coefficients in the calculations. However, we also compare our results with those obtained using other algorithms (NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate both the convergence of our results and their independence of the numerical scheme. Results. We find that small scale dissipation affects the saturated state of MHD turbulence. In agreement with recent similar numer-ical simulations done in the presence of a net vertical magnetic flux, we find that turbulent activity (measured by the rate of angular momentum transport) is an increasing function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm for all values of the Reynolds number Re that we investigated. We also found that turbulence disappears when the Prandtl number falls below a critical value Pm c that is apparently a decreasing function of Re. For the limited region of parameter space that can be probed with current computational resources, we always obtained Pm c {\textgreater} 1. Conclusions. We conclude that the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are important in determining the properties of MHD tur-bulence in numerical simulations in the shearing box with zero net flux, at least for Reynolds numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers that are such that transport is not dominated by numerical effects and thus can be probed using current computational resources.},

Using high-resolution spectral methods, we show that strongly turbulent convection can drive outward angular momentum transport at a rate that is, under certain conditions, compatible with observations of discs. We find, however, that the angular momentum transport is always much weaker than the vertical heat transport.

The kinetic magnetorota-tional instability grows from a subthermal magnetic field having zero net flux over the computational domain to generate self-sustained turbulence and outward angular-momentum transport. Significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses are accompanied by comparable viscous stresses produced by field-aligned ion pressure anisotropy, which is regulated primarily by the mirror and ion-cyclotron instabilities through particle trapping and pitch-angle scattering. The latter endow the plasma with an effective viscosity that is biased with respect to the magnetic-field direction and spatiotemporally variable. Energy spectra suggest an Alfv{\'{e}}n-wave cascade at large scales and a kinetic-Alfv{\'{e}}n-wave cascade at small scales, with strong small-scale density fluctuations and weak nonaxisymmetric density waves.

Here we explore experimentally a new and simple route to IAP generation directly from 35 fs IR pulses that undergo filamentation in argon. Spectral broadening, self-shortening of the IR pulse and HHG are realized in a single stage, reducing the cost and experimental effort for easier spreading of attosecond sources. We observe continuous XUV spectra supporting IAPs, emerging directly from the filament via a truncating pinhole to vacuum. The extremely short absorption length of the XUV radiation makes it a highly local probe for studying the elusive filamentation dynamics and in particular provides an experimental diagnostic of short-lived spikes in laser intensity. The excellent agreement with numerical simulations suggests the formation of a single-cycle pulse in the filament.},

We show how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to the disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual findings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations from time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the disk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the local disk magnetization and (i)the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass loading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate. Essentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and faster jets, and, due to a larger Alfv$\backslash$'en lever arm, these jets extract more angular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have, however, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass ejection-to-accretion ratio.

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of femtosecond laser pulses propagating in a hollow fiber filled with argon, through a full numerical solution of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. The simulation results show that, if the intensity is low and no ionization takes place, the spatial profile of the beam does not change very much so that its propagation model may be simplified to a one-dimensional model. If the intensity is high and ionization takes place, the spatial dynamics as well as temporal dynamics become very complicated because of self-focusing and defocusing. It is found that, for the same value of the B integral, self-focusing inside a hollow fiber can be substantially suspended by a differential gas pressure technique, where the gas pressure is set to be a minimum at the entrance and then increased with the propagation distance. Numerical simulations show that using such a technique, the energy transmitted during propagation inside hollow fiber is significantly enhanced, and the spatial phase is also improved.},

abstract = {The standard explanation for multiple filamentation of laser beams is that breakup of cylindrical symmetry is initiated by noise in the input beam. In this study we propose an alternative deterministic explanation based on vectorial effects. We derive a scalar equation from the vector Helmholtz equation that describes self-focusing in the presence of vectorial and nonparaxial effects. Numerical simulations of the scalar equation show that when the input beam is sufficiently powerful, vectorial effects lead to multiple filamentation. We compare multiple filamentation due to vectorial effects with the one due to noise, and suggest how to decide which of the two leads to multiple filamentation in experiments. We also show that vectorial effects and nonparaxiality have the same effect on self-focusing of a single filament, leading to the arrest of catastrophic collapse, followed by focusing-defocusing oscillations. The magnitude of vectorial effects is, however, significantly larger than that of nonparaxiality. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the mechanism for state transitions in black hole X-ray binary disks, we have proposed a series of local shearing box simulations. These simulations will systematically examine the impact of various physical effects on the MRI-driven angular momentum transport in these disks. In particular, nonzero viscosity and resistivity and their ratio, the magnetic Prandtl number, have been shown to have a strong effect on the angular momentum transport. Previous studies have focused on a limited set of initial conditions. We expand on these initial conditions in this paper in order to gain a deeper understanding of exactly how viscosity and resistivity affect the accretion flow. We find that for a purely azimuthal magnetic field configuration, which is more applicable to real accretion disks, the angular momentum transport depends strongly on the resistivity, but is nearly independent of the viscosity. This work serves as an essential stepping stone to constructing simulations where the viscosity and resistivity are temperature-dependent and are thus controlled by turbulent heating, radiative cooling, and vertical gravity.},

abstract = {The filamentation of optical beams in focusing Kerr media is investigated. First, the creation of filamentary structures is shown to strongly depend on the radial distribution of the incident beam in the diffraction plane. With a cubic nonlinearity, broadening an input beam from Gaussian to super-Gaussian (SG) shapes relaxes the self-focusing (SF) attractor and triggers the formation of independent filaments. Analytical criteria for the mutual coalescence of filaments in the context of collapsing and saturating nonlinearities are proposed. Second, the influence of the polarization state on the filamentation instability is investigated. Rigorous conditions for the SF of beams with different polarizations are derived, which prove that the power threshold for collapse noticeably increases for circularly-polarized beams. The growth rate for modulational instability decreases accordingly and the minimal separation distance for coalescence becomes larger, which slows down the production of uncorrelated filaments. Implications of these results in atmospheric propagation are finally discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations of accretion flows that cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented. The calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thick torus with constant specific angular momentum. Accretion is induced by the addition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by a function nu. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of nu are varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial scales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by and a large fraction of the mass participating in the accretion flow. Although the instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective eddies, long-time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to certain steady-state solutions. The two-dimensional structure of the time-averaged flow is marginally stable to the H{\o}iland criterion, indicating that convection is efficient. Near the equatorial plane, the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power laws with an index that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. A stress in which nu{\~{}}r1/2 recovers the widely studied self-similar solution corresponding to an `alpha-disc'. We find that, regardless of the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear stress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied to the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate associated with the flow properties near the central object.},

abstract = {It is demonstrated that the equation i∂$\psi$/∂t + $\psi$ + $\kappa$|$\psi$|²$\psi$ = 0, which describes plane self-focusing and one-dimensional self-modulation can be solved exactly by reducing it to the inverse scattering problem for a certain linear differential operator. In this case exact solutions can be obtained which describe the interaction of solitary wave packets - solitons. It is shown that the amplitude and velocity of interacting solitons do not change, whereas the phase has a discontinuity. It is also demonstrated that only paired collisions of solitons occur. The results obtained are used for assessing the nonlinear stage of development of self-modulated instability.},

abstract = {Significant progresses have been made since the discovery of hot accretion flow, a theory successfully applied to the low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) and black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (BHBs) in their hard states. Motivated by these updates, we re-investigate the radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow. We find that, the brightest regime of hot accretion flow shows a distinctive property, i.e. it has a constant efficiency independent of accretion rates, similar to the standard thin disk. For less bright regime, the efficiency has a steep positive correlation with the accretion rate, while for faint regime typical of advection-dominated accretion flow, the correlation is shadower. This result can naturally explain the observed two distinctive correlations between radio and X-ray luminosities in black hole X-ray binaries. The key difference in systems with distinctive correlations could be the viscous parameter, which determines the critical luminosity of different accretion modes.},

abstract = {Millimeter very long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A * (Sgr A *), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A * 's flux distribution at the 3.9$\sigma$ level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9$\sigma$ level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A * 's emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are a = 0.0 +0.64+0.86 , $\theta$ = 68 • +5 • +9 • −20 • −28 • , and $\xi$ = −52 • +17 • +33 • −15 • −24 • east of north, where the errors quoted are the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ uncertainties.},

Observations at millimeter wavelengths with the Event Horizon Telescope have localized the emission from the base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black hole horizon. The jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or by electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. However, even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintain the required magnetic flux near the black hole. Therefore, regardless of the jet mechanism, the observed jet power in M87 implies a certain minimum mass accretion rate. If the central compact object in M87 were not a black hole but had a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermal near-infrared and optical emission from the surface. Current flux limits on the nucleus of M87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. This rules out the presence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an event horizon.},

After a transient stage along which they vary in location and in amplitude, filaments triggered by an isotropic noise are confined into distinct clusters, called "optical pillars," whose evolution can be approximated by an averaged-in-time two-dimensional (2D) model derived from the standard propagation equations for ultrashort pulses. Results from this model are compared with space- and time-resolved numerical simulations. From the experimental point of view, similar clusters of filaments emerge from the defects of initial beam profiles delivered by the Teramobile laser facility.

abstract = {We present a pair of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of intermittent jets from a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy cluster extracted from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. The selected cluster was chosen as an apparently relatively relaxed system, not having undergone a major merger in almost 7 Gyr. Despite this characterization and history, the intracluster medium (ICM) contains quite active " weather. " We explore the effects of this ICM weather on the morphological evolution of the AGN jets and lobes. The orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe different aspects of the ICM structure and dynamics. We find that even for this cluster, which can be characterized as relaxed by an observational standard, the large-scale, bulk ICM motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes. Synthetic X-ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce complex cavity systems, while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of the jets and lobes similar to wide-angle tail radio sources. The jets are cycled on and off with a 26 Myr period using a 50{\%} duty cycle. This leads to morphological features similar to those in " double–double " radio galaxies. While the jet and ICM magnetic fields are generally too weak in the simulations to play a major role in the dynamics, Maxwell stresses can still become locally significant.},

During the past decade, many of these transient sources were observed daily throughout the course of their typically year-long outburst cycles using the large-area timing detector aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100-450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin.},

abstract = {The massive black hole in our Galactic centre, Sgr A * , accretes only a small fraction of the gas available at its Bondi radius. The physical processes determining this accretion rate remain unknown, partly due to a lack of observational constraints on the gas at distances between ∼10 and ∼10 5 Schwarzschild radii (R s) from the black hole. Recent infrared observations identify low-mass gas clouds, G1 and G2, moving on highly eccentric, nearly co-planar orbits through the accretion flow around Sgr A * . Although it is not yet clear whether these objects contain embedded stars, their extended gaseous envelopes evolve independently as gas clouds. In this paper we attempt to use these gas clouds to constrain the properties of the accretion flow at ∼10 3 R s . Assuming that G1 and G2 follow the same trajectory, we model the small differences in their orbital parameters as evolution resulting from interaction with the background flow. We find evolution consistent with the G-clouds originating in the clockwise disc. Our analysis enables the first unique determination of the rotation axis of the accretion flow: we localize the rotation axis to within 20 • , finding an orientation consistent with the parsec-scale jet identified},

abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher-order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume-averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area-averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally-split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally-unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and Fortran95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods. The source code is freely available for download on the web.},

abstract = {Modern laser sources nowadays deliver ultrashort light pulses reaching few cycles in duration, high energies beyond the Joule level and peak powers exceeding several terawatt (TW). When such pulses propagate through optically-transparent media, they first self-focus in space and grow in intensity, until they generate a tenuous plasma by photo-ionization. For free electron densities and beam intensities below their breakdown limits, these pulses evolve as self-guided objects, resulting from successive equilibria between the Kerr focusing process, the chromatic dispersion of the medium, and the defocusing action of the electron plasma. Discovered one decade ago, this self-channeling mechanism reveals a new physics, widely extending the frontiers of nonlinear optics. Implications include long-distance propagation of TW beams in the atmosphere, supercontinuum emission, pulse shortening as well as high-order harmonic generation. This review presents the landmarks of the 10-odd-year progress in this field. Particular emphasis is laid to the theoretical modeling of the propagation equations, whose physical ingredients are discussed from numerical simulations. Differences between femtosecond pulses propagating in gaseous or condensed materials are underlined. Attention is also paid to the multifilamentation instability of broad, powerful beams, breaking up the energy distribution into small-scale cells along the optical path. The robustness of the resulting filaments in adverse weathers, their large conical emission exploited for multipollutant remote sensing, nonlinear spectroscopy, and the possibility to guide electric discharges in air are finally addressed on the basis of experimental results.},

This break-up event in the refocus enhances the self-compression capabilities of laser filaments, enabling up to 12-fold temporal compression.

By properly employing a high-pass filter to select the broadening high-frequency spectra which are almost in phase, the pulse can be further shortened to about 7 fs. By contrast, a 6-fs pulse cannot be further self-compressed into a shorter pulse by filamentation although it can generate much broader SC extending from 200 nm to 1300 nm. It is also found that a separate and strong SC in the ultraviolet (UV) region extending from 220 nm to 300 nm and peaked at about 255 nm can be generated at proper propagation distances, which corresponds to a pulse with duration of about 5 fs.},

abstract = {Magnetorotational Instability (MRI), the instability causing turbulent transport in accretion disks, is studied in the kinetic regime. Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAFs), like the one around the supermassive black hole in the center of our Galaxy, are believed to be collisionless. Kinetic MHD formalism, based on the moments of the Vlasov equation, is used for linear analysis and nonlinear simulations. ZEUS MHD code is modified to include key kinetic MHD terms: anisotropic pressure tensor and anisotropic thermal conduction. Simulations use the local shearing box approximation. Pressure anisotropy is created, because of the adiabatic invariance ({\$}\backslashmu=p{\_}\backslashperp/B{\$}), as magnetic field is amplified by the MRI. Larmor radius scale instabilities--mirror, ion-cyclotron, and firehose--are excited at large pressure anisotropy. Pressure isotropization due to pitch angle scattering by these instabilities is included as a subgrid model. A key result of the kinetic MHD simulations is that the anisotropic (viscous) stress can be as large as the Maxwell stress. A new numerical method to simulate anisotropic thermal conduction with large temperature gradients is suggested. Simple tests show that the centered differencing of anisotropic thermal conduction can result in heat flowing from lower to higher temperatures, giving rise to negative temperatures. Limiting of transverse temperature gradients does not accentuate temperature extrema.},

@article{Kunz2011,
abstract = {In weakly collisional plasmas such as the intracluster medium (ICM), heat and momentum transport become anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field direction. Anisotropic heat conduction causes the slow magnetosonic wave to become buoyantly unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI) when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity and to the heat-flux–driven buoyancy instability (HBI) when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity. The local changes in magnetic field strength that attend these instabilities cause pressure anisotropies that viscously damp motions parallel to the magnetic field. In this paper we employ a linear stability analysis to elucidate the effects of anisotropic viscosity (i.e. Braginskii pressure anisotropy) on the MTI and HBI. By stifling the convergence/divergence of magnetic field lines, pressure anisotropy significantly affects how the ICM interacts with the temperature gradient. Instabilities which depend upon the convergence/divergence of magnetic field lines to generate unstable buoyant motions (the HBI) are suppressed over much of the wavenumber space, whereas those which are otherwise impeded by field-line convergence/divergence (the MTI) are strengthened. As a result, the wavenumbers at which the HBI survives largely unsuppressed in the ICM have parallel components too small to rigorously be considered local. This is particularly true as the magnetic field becomes more and more orthogonal to the temperature gradient. The field-line insulation found by recent numerical simulations to be a non-linear consequence of the standard HBI might therefore be attenuated. In contrast, the fastest growing MTI modes are unaffected by anisotropic viscosity. However, we find that anisotropic viscosity couples slow and Alfv{\'{e}}n waves in such a way as to buoyantly destabilize Alfv{\'{e}}nic fluctuations when the temperature increases in the direction of gravity. Consequently, many wavenumbers previously considered MTI stable or slow growing are in fact maximally unstable. We discuss the physical interpretation of these instabilities in detail.},

We also demonstrate that the resulting two-zone ADIOS models are not dynamically self-consistent without the introduction of an energy source close in to the central regions of the flow; we identify this with the energy liberated by accretion. We explore the parameter space of non-radiative models and show that both powerful winds and gentle breezes are possible. When small radiative losses (with fixed efficiency) are included, any centrally injected energy flux is radiated away and the system reverts to a power-law behavior with n {\textless} 1, where n falls in a small range determined by the fractional level of radiative losses. We also present an ADIOS model for hypercritical (super-Eddington) disk accretion, in which the radiative losses are closely related to the flow geometry. We suggest that hyperaccretion can lead to either winds or breezes.},

We have implemented photon-conserving Comptonization in the general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL and we describe its impact on simulations of mildly super-critical black hole accretion disks. We find that blackbody Comptonization underestimates the gas and radiation temperature by up to a factor of two compared to photon-conserving Comptonization. This discrepancy could be serious when computing spectra. The photon-conserving simulation indicates that the spectral color correction factor of the escaping radiation in the funnel region of the disk could be as large as 5.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the thermal coupling of ions and electrons in the con-text of optically thin, hot accretion flows is investigated in a phenomenological approach. In the limit of complete coupling, we focus on the one-temperature accretion flows around black holes. Based on a global analysis, the results are compared with two-temperature accretion flow models and with the observations of black hole sources. A comparison of the properties of the one-temperature so-lutions with that of the two-temperature solutions reveals many features that are quite similar. That is, hot one-temperature solutions are found to exist for mass flow rates less than a critical value; i.e., ˙ M 10$\alpha$ 2 ˙ M Edd , where ˙ M Edd = L Edd /c 2 is the Eddington accretion rate. At low mass flow rates, ˙ M 10 −3 $\alpha$ 2 ˙ M Edd , the viscous energy is mainly balanced by the advective cooling, i.e., the solution is in the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) regime. On the other hand, at higher rates, 10 −3 $\alpha$ 2 ˙ M Edd ˙ M 10$\alpha$ 2 ˙ M Edd , radiative cooling is effective and is mainly balanced by advective heating, placing the solution in the regime of lumi-nous hot accretion flow (LHAF). At the highest mass flow rates, ˙ M 10$\alpha$ 2 ˙ M Edd , – 2 – the accretion flow collapses at a transition radius (which increases with increas-ing mass flow rate) with only the standard optically thick and geometrically thin disk solution existing in the innermost regions. To test the viability of the one-temperature models, we have fitted the spectra of the two black hole sources, Sgr A* and XTE J1118+480, which have been examined successfully with two-temperature models. It is found that the one-temperature models do not provide acceptable fits to the multi-wavelength spectra of Sgr A* nor to XTE J1118+480 as a result of the higher temperatures characteristic of the one-temperature mod-els. It is concluded that the thermal coupling of ions and electrons cannot be fully effective and that a two-temperature description is required in hot accretion flow solutions.},

The forward transformation (primitive to conserved) has a closed-form solution, but the inverse transformation (conserved to primitive) requires the solution of a set of five nonlinear equations. Here we discuss the mathematical properties of the inverse transformation and present six numerical methods for performing the inversion. The first method solves the full set of five nonlinear equations directly using a Newton-Raphson scheme and a guess from the previous time step. The other methods reduce the five nonlinear equations to either one or two nonlinear equations that are solved numerically. Comparisons between the methods are made using a survey over phase space, a two-dimensional explosion problem, and a general relativistic MHD accretion disk simulation. The run time of the methods is also examined. Code implementing the schemes is available with the electronic edition of the article.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, our understanding of hot accretion flows has been improved signif-icantly by two findings: (i) only a small fraction of the accretion flow available at the outer boundary can finally fall on to the black hole, while most of it is lost in the outflow; (ii) electrons can directly receive a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow (i.e. $\delta$ ∼ 0.1–0.5). The radiative efficiency of the hot accretion flow when these two findings are taken into account has not yet been systematically studied, and this is the subject of our paper. We consider two regimes of the hot accretion model: advection-dominated accretion flows that lie in the regime of the low accretion rate, 10$\alpha$},

Second-order polynomial fitting of DC-Kerr, $\gamma$((2))(-$\omega$; $\omega$, 0, 0), electric field induced second harmonic generation (ESHG), $\gamma$((2))(-2$\omega$; $\omega$, $\omega$, 0), and static second-order hyperpolarizability, $\gamma$((2))(0; 0, 0, 0), is performed using an auxiliary electric field approach to obtain the corresponding fourth-order optical properties. A number of basis sets are investigated for the fourth-order hyperpolarizability processes at 800 nm at coupled cluster singles and doubles level of theory, starting with the t-aug-cc-pV5Z basis set and expanding that basis set by adding diffuse functions and polarization functions. Comparison shows that the results obtained with the t-aug-cc-pV5Z basis are in very good agreement with the results obtained using the q-aug-cc-pV5Z, t-aug-cc-pV6Z, and q-aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets. To calculate the nonlinear refractive index n4, an approximate formula is suggested which expresses the related degenerate six-wave mixing coefficient, $\gamma$((4))(-$\omega$; $\omega$, -$\omega$, $\omega$, -$\omega$, $\omega$), in terms of the DC-Kerr, $\gamma$((4))(-$\omega$; $\omega$, 0, 0, 0, 0), ESHG, $\gamma$((4))(-2$\omega$; $\omega$, $\omega$, 0, 0, 0), and the static fourth-order hyperpolarizability coefficients. The higher-order nonlinear refractive index n4 is found to be positive over the wavelengths 300 nm-2000 nm. In the infrared spectral range, the obtained values of n4 are in qualitative agreement with the results of Kramers-Kronig-based calculations.},

abstract = {We have investigated several different regimes of seeded parametric amplification. The choice of the seed configuration determines whether the CEP of the idler pulses becomes fixed or, alternatively, it drifts while the idler and signal pulses remain phase-locked. In our opinion, an OPA of the former kind (phase-stabilizing) can be effectively employed in a sequence of femtosecond laser amplifiers for production of intense CEP-locked pulses, thus dispensing with intricate schemes of active CEP control. On the other hand, phase-repeating OPAs offer a relatively easy way to synthesize single-cycle pulses and, additionally, can be used for accurate determination of the phase offset for each individual laser shot. We believe that this work provides a new insight into the experimental capabilities of various OPA systems and opens attractive possibilities for their use in field-sensitive applications of nonlinear optics.},

A $\delta$ f scheme is included to facilitate a reduced-noise study of systems in which only small departures from an initial distribution function are anticipated. The effects of rotation and shear are implemented through the shearing-sheet formalism with orbital advection. These algorithms are embedded within an architecture similar to that used in the popular astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code Athena, one that is modular, well-documented, easy to use, and efficiently parallelized for use on thousands of processors.

The relation between the luminosity of the hard-to-soft state transition and the peak luminosity of the following HS state confirms the linear relation found previously. This implies that the luminosity of the hard-to-soft state transition is not determined solely by the mass accretion rate, but appears to be determined by the peak luminosity of the soft X-ray outburst. We also found that the LH-to-HS state transition occurred at a luminosity similar to that of the corresponding HS-to-LH state transition, i.e., there is no apparent hysteresis. These results provide additional evidence that the mass in the accretion disk affects the luminosity of the hard-to-soft state transition, and that the accretion flow that powers the LH state is related to the accretion flow that powers the HS state at a later time.},

abstract = {Black holes accreting well below the Eddington rate are believed to have geometrically thick, optically thin, rotationally supported accretion discs in which the Coulomb mean free path is large compared to {\$}GM/c{\^{}}2{\$}. In such an environment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal magnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric simulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The simulations are carried out using a new code {\$}{\{}\backslashrm\backslashit grim{\}}{\$}, which evolves a covariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal effects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are modeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference between the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model relies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering and velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the pressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it saturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces outward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD turbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the wall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations, conduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux is constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to perpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an increase in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability.},

abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of magnetorotational instability in a local patch of accretion disk in which radiation pressure exceeds gas pressure. Such conditions may occur in the central regions of disks surrounding compact objects in active galactic nuclei and Galactic X-ray sources. We assume axisymmetry and neglect vertical stratification. The growth rates of the instability on initially uniform magnetic fields are consistent with the linear analysis of Blaes {\&} Socrates (2001). As is the case when radiation effects are neglected, the nonlinear development of the instability leads to transitory turbulence when the initial magnetic field has no net vertical flux. During the turbulent phase, angular momentum is transported outward. The Maxwell stress is a few times the Reynolds stress, and their sum is about 4 times the mean pressure in the vertical component of the magnetic field. For magnetic pressure exceeding gas pressure, turbulent fluctuations in the field produce density contrasts about equal to the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure. These are many times larger than in the corresponding gas pressure-dominated situation and may have profound implications for the steady state vertical structure of radiation-dominated disks. Diffusion of radiation from compressed regions damps turbulent motions, converting kinetic energy into photon energy.},

Lett. 35, 2550 (2010)] for testing the recently proposed higher-order Kerr effect model. Our observations show that although the fifth-order nonlinearity is non-negligible, the overall defocusing effect via the higher-order nonlinearities is sufficiently small that plasma formation should be a main defocusing mechanism in high power filamentation. We also explore cross-phase modulation via the optical Kerr effect, and find that the higher-order nonlinearities can significantly alter the phase matching of harmonic generation.},

abstract = {The nature of accretion onto stellar mass black holes in the low/hard state remains unresolved, with some evidence suggesting that the inner accretion disc is truncated and replaced by a hot flow. However, the detection of relativistic broadened Fe emission lines, even at relatively low luminosities, seems to require an accretion disc extending fully to its innermost stable circular orbit. Modelling such features is, however, highly susceptible to degeneracies, which could easily bias any interpretation. We present the first systematic study of the Fe line region to track how the inner accretion disc evolves in the low/hard state of the black hole GX 339-4. Our four observations display increased broadening of the Fe line over two magnitudes in luminosity, which we use to track any variation of the disc inner radius. We find that the disc extends closer to the black hole at higher luminosities, but is consistent with being truncated throughout the entire low/hard state, a result which renders black hole spin estimates inaccurate at these stages of the outburst. Furthermore, we show that the evolution of our spectral inner disc radius estimates corresponds very closely to the trend of the break frequency in Fourier power spectra, supporting the interpretation of a truncated and evolving disc in the hard state.},

A model for the propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in a capillary tube, coupled with the tunnel ionization of the gas filling the capillary tube, is derived and solved numerically using the parameters of these experiments. The simulations accurately reproduce experimentally measured damping lengths, transmitted pulse energy and spectrum at the output of the capillary tube.

@article{BH1998,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

As a result, the trace shear unambiguously reveals both the magnitude and sign of the pulse spatial chirp. The effects of spatial chirp can then be removed from the trace and the intensity and phase vs. time also retrieved, yielding a full description of the spatially chirped pulse in space and time.},

The transversal spatial dependence of the temporal pulse profile was investigated by spatial selection of parts of the output beam. Selecting the central core of the beam is required for obtaining the shortest possible pulses. Higher energy efficiency is only obtained at the expense of pulse contrast since towards the outer parts of the beam the energy is spread into satellite structures leading to a double-pulse profile on the very off-axis part of the beam. Depending on the requirements for a particular application, a trade-off between the pulse duration and the pulse energy has to be done. The energy of the sub-5-fs pulses produced was sufficient for the generation of high order harmonics in Argon. In addition, full simulation is performed in space and time on pulse propagation through filamentation that explains the double-pulse structure observed as part of a conical emission enhanced by the plasma defocusing.},

abstract = {Using long-duration general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion discs, the energy, momentum and mass outflow rates from such systems are estimated. Outflows occur via two fairly distinct modes: a relativistic jet and a sub-relativistic wind. The jet power depends strongly on the black hole spin and on the magnetic flux at the horizon. Unless these are very small, the energy output in the jet dominates over that in the wind. For a rapidly spinning black hole accreting in the magnetically arrested limit, it is confirmed that jet power exceeds the total rate of accretion of rest mass energy. However, because of strong collimation, the jet probably does not have a significant feedback effect on its immediate surroundings. The power in the wind is more modest and shows a weaker dependence on black hole spin and magnetic flux. Nevertheless, because the wind subtends a large solid angle, it is expected to provide efficient feedback on a wide range of scales inside the host galaxy. Empirical formulae are obtained for the energy and momentum outflow rates in the jet and the wind.},

Most models assume alignment between the accretion disc and black hole angular momentum axes, but this is not necessarily the case for geometrically thick accretion flows like that on to Sgr A*. Instead, we calculate images and spectra from a set of numerical simulations of accretion flows misaligned ('tilted') by 15 • from the black hole spin axis and compare them with millimetre (mm) to near-infrared (NIR) observations. Non-axisymmetric standing shocks from eccentric fluid orbits dominate the emission, leading to a wide range of possible image morphologies. The strong effects of disc tilt lead to poorly constrained model parameters. These results suggest that previous parameter estimates from fitting aligned models, including estimates of the dimensionless black hole spin, likely only apply for small values of spin or tilt (upper limits of a {\textless} 0.3 or $\beta$ {\textless} 15 •). At 1.3 mm, the black hole images have crescent morphologies},

Our results demonstrate that although multiple filament arrays emerge as apparently regular patterns in the space domain, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the individual filaments is governed by the input-beam power and the input-beam ellipticity. In the case of moderate input-beam ellipticity, the individual filaments propagate in curved trajectories arising from skewed (spatiotemporal) coherence. The spatiotemporal propagation dynamics is regularized by increasing the input- beam ellipticity, and in part due to permanent modifications of fused silica that occur under intense irradiation. In this case, strong pulse reshaping and shock-front generation are observed, which yields a regular array of very short ({\textless}5 fs) superluminally propagating localized peaks in the leading front, followed by the subpulses centered on the input-pulse top, and trailed by subluminally propagating pulses with rather complex transverse intensity distribution.},

This leads to a system of equations that takes into account nonparaxiality, vectorial effects, and coupling to the opposite circular component (i.e., the one rotating in the opposite direction). Using this system we show that the standard model in the literature for self-focusing of circularly polarized beams can lead to completely wrong results, that circular polarization is stable during self-focusing, and that nonparaxiality and vectorial effects arrest collapse, leading instead to focusing-defocusing oscillations. We also show that circularly polarized beams are much less likely to undergo multiple filamentation than linearly polarized beams.},

abstract = {The stratiÐcation of entropy and the stratiÐcation of angular momentum are closely analogous. The analogy has been developed for a number of di†erent problems in the {\~{N}}uid literature, but its conse- quences for the behavior of turbulent accretion disks are less appreciated. Of particular interest is the behavior of disks in which angular momentum transport is controlled by convection, and heat transport by dynamical turbulence. In both instances we argue that the transport must proceed ““ backward {\"{I}}{\"{I}} rela- tive to the sense one would expect from a simple enhanced di†usion approach. Reversed angular momentum transport has already been seen in numerical simulations ; contragradient thermal di†usion should be amenable to numerical veriÐcation as well. These arguments also bear on the observed nonlin- ear local stability of isolated Keplerian disks : locally generated turbulence in such a disk would require simultaneous inward and outward angular momentum transport, which is, of course, impossible. We also describe a di†usive instability that is the entropy analogue to the magnetorotational instability. It a†ects thermally stratiÐed layers when Coulomb conduction and a weak magnetic Ðeld are present. The plasma must be sufficiently dilute that heat is channeled only along Ðeld lines. The criterion for convective insta- bility goes from one of upwardly decreasing entropy to one of upwardly decreasing temperature. The instability remains formally viable if radiative heat transport is also present, but the equilibrium is much more unstable if Coulomb transport is dominant. In that case, the maximum growth rate is of the order of the inverse sound crossing time, independent of the thermal conductivity. The indi†erence of the growth rate to the conduction coefficient, its simple dynamical scaling, and the replacement in the stabil- ity criterion of a conserved quantity (entropy) gradient by a free energy (temperature) gradient are properties similar to those exhibited by the magnetorotational instability.},

abstract = {Motivated by the ongoing controversy on the origin of the nonlinear index saturation and subsequent intensity clamping in femtosecond filaments, we study the atomic nonlinear polarization induced by a high-intensity and ultrashort laser pulse in hydrogen by numerically solving the time dependent Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation. Special emphasis is given to the efficient modeling of the nonlinear polarization at central laser frequency corresponding to 800 nm wavelength. Here, the recently proposed model of the Higher-Order Kerr Effect (HOKE) and two versions of the Standard model for femtosecond filamentation, including either a multi-photon or tunnel ionization rate, are compared. We find that around the clamping intensity the instantaneous HOKE model does not reproduce the temporal structure of the nonlinear response obtained from the quantum mechanical results. In contrast, the non-instantaneous charge contributions included in the Standard models ensure a reasonable quantitative agreement. Therefore, the physical origin for the observed saturation of the overall electron response is confirmed to mainly result from contributions of free or nearly free electrons.},

The variational approach, the so-called exactly and quasi- self-similar analyses employed for modelling wave collapse are then compared. Besides, the influence of the group-velocity dispersion and deviations from the spatio-temporal envelope approximations are investigated as structural perturbations of the NLS standard models, which can strongly alter the blow-up dynamics.

abstract = {This paper is aimed to review the recent observational results regard-ing $\gamma$-ray emission from active galaxies. Since the most numerous dis-crete extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources are AGN dominated by relativistic jets pointing in our direction (commonly known as blazars), those are the main subject of the review. Those objects are detected in all observ-able energy bands, and are highly variable. The advent of the sensitive $\gamma$-ray observations, afforded by the launch and continuing operation of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AGILE Gamma-ray Imag-ing Detector, as well as by the deployment of current-generation Air Cerenkov Telescope arrays such as VERITAS, MAGIC, and H.E.S.S.-II, continually provides sensitive $\gamma$-ray data over the energy range of ∼ 100 MeV to multi-TeV. Importantly, it has motivated simultaneous, monitoring observations in other bands, resulting in an unprecedented time resolved broad-band spectral coverage. After an introduction, in Sections 3, 4, and 5, we cover the current status and highlights of $\gamma$-ray observations with (mainly) Fermi but also AGILE, and put those in the context of broad-band spectra in Section 6. We discuss the radiation processes operating in blazars in section 7, and discuss the content of their jets and the constraints on the location of the energy dissipation regions in respectively Sections 8 and 9. Section 10 covers the current ideas for particle acceleration processes in jets, and Section 11 discusses the coupling of the jet to the accretion disk in the host galaxy. Finally, Sections 12, 13, and 14 cover the contribution of blazars to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, the utility of blazars to study the extragalactic back-ground light, and the insight they provide for study of population of supermassive black holes early in the history of the Universe.},

We compare solutions previously computed using the ZEUS code with new results from Athena for both applications. Both codes converge to the same solution as measured by globally averaged quantities; for example the decay rate of supersonic MHD turbulence is the same. This, combined with the recent demonstration that the ZEUS code gives the correct solution to all of the one-dimensional test problems in Falle (2002), suggests that ZEUS is reliable for astrophysical MHD.},

The electromagnetic field (laser pulse) is modeled using Maxwell's equations coupled with many time dependent quantum Schrdinger equations modeling the molecular gas thus including an ab initio description of the laser-molecule interaction. This Maxwell-Schrdinger-Plasma, MASP, model allows us to include high harmonics, self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. At the intensities, we consider that the gas is partially ionized leading to the creation of a free electron plasma which contributes to the pulse defocusing. We then present a series of numerical simulations showing the behavior of the MASP model depending on the gas density, and initial laser intensity. In particular, self-focusing and self-defocusing effects as well as filament-like behaviors are presented and discussed. A scaling theory is developed for large propagations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Using numerical MHD simulations, we have studied the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in stratified accretion disks in which the ionization fraction (and therefore resistivity) varies substan-tially with height. This model is appropriate to dense, cold disks around protostars or dwarf nova systems, which are ionized by external irradiation of cosmic rays or high-energy photons. We find that the growth and saturation of the MRI occurs only in the upper layers of the disk where the magnetic Reynolds number exceeds a critical value; in the midplane the disk remains quiescent. The vertical Poynting flux into the '' dead '' central zone is small; however, velocity fluctuations in the dead zone driven by the turbulence in the active layers generate a significant Reynolds stress in the midplane. When normalized by the thermal pres-sure, the Reynolds stress in the midplane never drops below about 10{\%} of the value of the Maxwell stress in the active layers, even though the Maxwell stress in the dead zone may be orders of magnitude smaller than this. Significant mass mixing occurs between the dead zone and active layers. Fluctuations in the magnetic energy in the active layers can drive vertical oscillations of the disk in models in which the ratio of the column density in the dead zone to that in the active layers is less than 10. These results have important implications for the global evolution of a layered disk; in particular, there may be residual mass inflow in the dead layer. We discuss the effects that dust in the disk may have on our results.},

The theoretical technique for measuring the magnetic helicity from the matrix of two-point correlations is shown. The length scales characterizing the magnetic helicity are found to be equal to or greater than those which characterize the magnetic energy. The magnetic helicity typically lies at scales larger than the magnetic correlation length, consistent with the expectations of the inverse cascade and selective decay hypotheses of three-dimensional MHD turbulence. At smaller scales, the magnetic helicity oscillates in sign. Measurements of the cross helicity are not fully consistent with the usual interpretation in terms of outward propagating Alfvenic functions.

The detected backscattered nitrogen fluorescence from inside the filaments yielded irregular changes from shot to shot which cannot be explained by fluctuation arising from the initial laser pulse itself. Numerical simulations reveal a complex dynamics of multiple filament propagation and interaction dynamics that depends strongly on the initial perturbations of the laser beam. The irregular changes of the fluorescence signal are attributed to the interference between adjacent hot spots that evolve into filaments which give rise to new hot spots (filaments) in between, and thus give the appearance of the fusion or branching of filaments.},

abstract = {We study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on magnetized spherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric MHD simulations. In low collisionality plasmas, the Bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI). The MTI grows rapidly at large radii where the inflow is subsonic. For a weak initial field, the MTI saturates by creating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e., by aligning the field lines with the background temperature gradient. The saturation is quasilinear in the sense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim 10-30{\$} independent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). In the saturated state, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux, and is comparable to the field-free (Spitzer) value (since the field lines are largely radial). The MTI by itself does not appreciably change the accretion rate {\$}\backslashdot M{\$} relative to the Bondi rate {\$}\backslashdot M{\_}B{\$}. However, the radial field lines created by the MTI are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows in to small radii. Oppositely directed field lines are brought together by the converging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. When the magnetic energy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, the plasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highly subsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large radii by thermal conduction; and the accretion rate {\$}\backslashdot M \backslashll \backslashdot M{\_}B{\$}. The predominantly radial magnetic field created by the MTI at large radii in spherical accretion flows may account for the stable Faraday rotation measure towards Sgr A* in the Galactic Center.},

abstract = {Black holes that accrete far below the Eddington limit are believed to accrete through a geometrically thick, optically thin, rotationally supported plasma that we will refer to as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). RIAFs are typically collisionless in the sense that the Coulomb mean free path is large compared to GM c 2 , and relativistically hot near the event horizon. In this paper we develop a phenomenological model for the plasma in RIAFs, motivated by the application to sources such as Sgr A * and M87. The model is derived using Israel–Stewart theory, which considers deviations up to second order from thermal equilibrium, but modified for a magnetized plasma. This leads to thermal conduction along magnetic field lines and a difference in pressure, parallel and perpendicular to the field lines (which is equivalent to anisotropic viscosity). In the non-relativistic limit, our model reduces to the widely used Braginskii theory of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. We compare our model to the existing literature on dissipative relativistic fluids, describe the linear theory of the plasma, and elucidate the physical meaning of the free parameters in the model. We also describe limits of the model when the conduction is saturated and when the viscosity implies a large pressure anisotropy. In future work, the formalism developed in this paper will be used in numerical models of RIAFs to assess the importance of non-ideal processes for the dynamics and radiative properties of slowly accreting black holes.},

Our analysis was performed for a laser pulse that was predominantly in the fundamental mode and revealed the physical processes involved in self-focusing in a hollow waveguide. A critical power for self-focusing was obtained that was found to be substantially higher than the critical power for self-focusing in a bulk medium. Useful design criteria for pulse-compression systems are presented. We identify the parameter range for which the transverse variation of the pulse phase introduced by the Kerr nonlinearity is small.},

abstract = {Many astrophysical plasmas and some laboratory plasmas are relativistic: Either the thermal speed or the local bulk flow in some frame approaches the speed of light. Often, such plasmas are magnetized in the sense that the Larmor radius is smaller than any gradient scale length of interest. Conventionally, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ͑MHD͒ is employed to treat relativistic, magnetized plasmas. However, MHD requires the collision time to be shorter than any other time scale in the system. Thus, MHD employs the thermodynamic equilibrium form of the stress tensor, neglecting pressure anisotropy and heat flow parallel to the magnetic field. Recent work has attempted to remedy these shortcomings. This paper re-examines the closure question and finds a more complete theory, which yields a more physical and self-consistent closure. Beginning with exact moments of the kinetic equation, we derive a closed set of Lorentz-covariant fluid equations for a magnetized plasma allowing for pressure and heat flow anisotropy. Basic predictions of the model, especially of the dispersion relation's dependence upon relativistic temperature, are examined.},

abstract = {We perform 3D vertically-stratified local shearing-box ideal MHD simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) that include a net vertical magnetic flux, which is characterized by beta{\_}0 (ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure of the net vertical field at midplane). We have considered beta{\_}0=10{\^{}}2, 10{\^{}}3 and 10{\^{}}4 and in the first two cases the most unstable linear MRI modes are well resolved in the simulations. We find that the behavior of the MRI turbulence strongly depends on beta{\_}0: The radial transport of angular momentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta{\_}0=10{\^{}}4 and alpha{\textgreater}1.0 for beta{\_}0=100, where alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter. A critical value lies at beta{\_}0=10{\^{}}3: For beta{\_}0{\textgreater}10{\^{}}3, the disk consists of a gas pressure dominated midplane and a magnetically dominated corona. The turbulent strength increases with net flux, and angular momentum transport is dominated by turbulent fluctuations. The magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips of large-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net flux increases. For beta{\_}0{\textless}10{\^{}}3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated. The turbulent strength saturates, and the magnetic dynamo is quenched. Stronger large-scale fields are generated with increasing net flux, which dominates angular momentum transport. A strong outflow is launched from the disk by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism, and the mass flux increases linearly with net vertical flux and shows sign of saturation at beta{\_}0=10{\^{}}2. However, the outflow is unlikely to be directly connected to a global wind: for beta{\_}0{\textgreater}10{\^{}}3, the large-scale field has no permanent bending direction due to dynamo activities, while for beta{\_}0{\textless}10{\^{}}3, the outflows from the top and bottom sides of the disk bend towards opposite directions, inconsistent with a physical disk wind geometry. Global simulations are needed to address the fate of the outflow.},

The dynamics of the two plasmas and their interaction are studied with and without magnetic field through spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the electron density. Experimental results show that counter-propagating collisionless plasmas interpenetrate when no magnetic field is present. In contrast, results obtained with the addition of a 7.5 T magnetic field perpendicular to plasma flow show density features in the interaction area that only occur when the field is present. The reason for this remains uncertain. It is suggested that this results from an increase in the effective collisionality as the magnetic field reduces the ion and electron gyroradius below the size of the experiment.},

abstract = {These lecture notes and example problems are based on a course given at the University of Cambridge in Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena, such as the formation and internal dynamics of stars and giant planets, the workings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes and the dynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in astrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the dynamical influence of the magnetic field that is ‘frozen in' to a highly conducting plasma. The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The mathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated conservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for both analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other discontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be solved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal the physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as their stability and their response to tidal forcing.},

abstract = {Simple assumptions made regarding electron thermodynamics often limit the extent to which general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations can be applied to observations of low-luminosity accreting black holes. We present, implement, and test a model that self-consistently evolves an electron entropy equation and takes into account the effects of spatially varying electron heating and relativistic anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. We neglect the back-reaction of electron pressure on the dynamics of the accretion flow. Our model is appropriate for systems accreting at {\$}\backslashll 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$} of the Eddington rate, so radiative cooling by electrons can be neglected. It can be extended to higher accretion rates in the future by including electron cooling and proton-electron Coulomb collisions. We present a suite of tests showing that our method recovers the correct solution for electron heating under a range of circumstances, including strong shocks and driven turbulence. Our initial applications to axisymmetric simulations of accreting black holes show that (1){\~{}}physically-motivated electron heating rates yield electron temperature distributions significantly different from the constant electron to proton temperature ratios assumed in previous work, with higher electron temperatures concentrated in the coronal region between the disc and the jet; (2){\~{}}electron thermal conduction significantly modifies the electron temperature in the inner regions of black hole accretion flows if the effective electron mean free path is larger than the local scale-height of the disc (at least for the initial conditions and magnetic field configurations we study). The methods developed in this work are important for producing more realistic predictions for the emission from accreting black holes such as Sagittarius A* and M87; these applications will be explored in future work.},

abstract = {Multiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients have opened a new path to understanding the physics of the innermost parts of the accretion flows. While the processes giving rise to their X-ray continuum have been studied extensively, the emission in the optical and infrared (OIR) energy bands was less investigated and remains poorly understood. The standard accretion disc, which may contribute to the flux at these wavelengths, is not capable of explaining a number of observables: the infrared excesses, fast OIR variability and a complicated correlation with the X-rays. It was suggested that these energy bands are dominated by the jet emission; however, this scenario does not work in a number of cases. We propose here an alternative, namely that most of the OIR emission is produced by the extended hot accretion flow. In this scenario, the OIR bands are dominated by the synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons. An additional contribution is expected from the outer irradiated part of the accretion disc heated by the X-rays. We discuss the properties of the model and compare them to the data. We show that the hot-flow scenario is consistent with many of the observed spectral data, at the same time naturally explaining X-ray timing properties, fast OIR variability and its correlation with the X-rays.},

abstract = {Previous studies of the non-linear regime of the magnetorotational instability in one particular type of shearing box model – unstratified with no net magnetic flux – find that without explicit dissipation (viscosity and resistivity) the saturation amplitude decreases with increasing nu-merical resolution. We show that this result is strongly dependent on the vertical aspect ratio of the computational domain L z /L x . When L z /L x 1, we recover previous results. However, when the vertical domain is extended L z /L x 2.5, we find the saturation level of the stress is greatly increased (giving a ratio of stress to pressure $\alpha$ 0.1), and moreover the results are independent of numerical resolution. Consistent with previous results, we find that saturation of the magnetorotational (MRI) in this regime is controlled by a cyclic dynamo which gener-ates patches of strong toroidal field that switches sign on scales of L x in the vertical direction. We speculate that when L z /L x 1, the dynamo is inhibited by the small size of the vertical domain, leading to the puzzling dependence of saturation amplitude on resolution. We show that previous toy models developed to explain the MRI dynamo are consistent with our results, and that the cyclic pattern of toroidal fields observed in stratified shearing box simulations (leading to the so-called butterfly diagram) may also be related. In tall boxes the saturation amplitude is insensitive to whether or not explicit dissipation is included in the calculations, at least for large magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl number. Finally, we show MRI turbulence in tall domains has a smaller critical Pm c , and an extended lifetime compared to L z /L x 1 boxes.},

abstract = {The ability to make precise and spatially resolved measurements of velocity in gas flows, particularly air flows, is crucial for understanding fluid dynamics, developing computational codes to simulate fluids, and optimizing the design of engineering applications that interact with fluids. In this report we characterize femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging (FLEET), a novel optical flow diagnostic potentially allowing simultaneous high resolution line measurements of velocity, temperature, density, and species concentration. A line of long lived emission generated in the focal region of the laser can be followed with a fast- gated camera; displacement of the line and knowledge of the image timing give flow velocity. The probable mechanism underlying FLEET has been determined to be dissociation of molecular nitrogen by femtosecond laser pulse into atomic nitrogen; recombination of the ni- trogen atoms drives emission from the nitrogen first positive system. We have demonstrated FLEET's velocimetry capabilities in free jets with single shot uncertainties on the order of meters per second and 100 µm spatial resolution. Strong emission from the nitrogen second positive system offers the possibility of extracting gas temperature from the shape of the rotational spectra and ratios between the second positive and first negative systems and our results confirm an ability to distinguish spectra at different temperatures. FLEET's ability to make line measurements with high spatial resolution is ideal for studying turbulence, and we have demonstrated the measurement of turbulent parameters. FLEET also offers the possibility of making density and species measurements from Rayleigh scattering and the emission spectrum, although these capabilities have not been experimentally demonstrated. As an unseeded, high resolution, and relatively simple system, FLEET offers several advan- tages over existing flow diagnostic methods, and may be suitable for deployment in a wide variety of applications.},

abstract = {This review considers the theory of the magnetic field line reconnection a{\~{}}Ld its application to the problem of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere. In particular, we discuss the reconnection models by Sonnerup and by Petschek (for both incompressible and compressible plasmas, for the asymmetric and nonsteady-state cases), the magnetic field annihilation model by Parker; Syro-vatsky's model of the current sheet; and Birn's and Schindler's solution for the plasma sheet structure. A review of laboratory and numerical modelling experiments is given. Results concerning the field line reconnection, combined with the peculiarities of the MHD flow, were used in investigating the solar wind flow around the magnetosphere. We found that in the presence of a frozen-in magnetic field, the flow differs significantly from that in a pure gas dynamic case; in particular, at the subsolar, part of the magnetopause a 'stagnation' line appears (i.e., a line along which the stream lines are branching) instead of a stagnation point. The length and location of the stagnation line determine the character of the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. We have developed the theory of that interaction for a steady-state case, and compare the results of the calculations with the experimental data. In the last section of the review, we propose a qualitative model of the solar wind -the Earth's magnetosphere interaction in the nonsteady-state case on the basis of the solution of the problem of the spontaneous magnetic field line reconnection.},

abstract = {For magnetized accretion flows with very low accretion rates such as that in the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center, {\$}Sgr A{\^{}}*{\$}, the mean free path of electrons is much greater than the Larmor radius and is an appreciable fraction of the size of the system. In this case, the thermal conduction is anisotropic and dynamically important. Provided that the magnetic field is weak, magnetothermal instability (MTI) exists . It can amplify the magnetic field and align the field lines with the temperature gradient (i.e., the radial direction). If the accretion flow is differentially rotating, magnetorotational instability (MRI) also exists as well known. In this paper, we investigate the possible interaction of these two instabilities. We study a hot accretion flow around Bondi radius, where the infall timescale of gas is longer than the MTI and MRI growth timescales, thus MTI and MRI coexist. We focus on the interaction between MTI and MRI by examining the magnetic field amplification induced by the two instabilities. We find that MTI and MRI mainly amplify the radial and toroidal components of the magnetic field, respectively. Most importantly, we find that if MTI alone can amplify the magnetic field by a factor of {\$}F{\_}t{\$} and MRI alone by a factor of {\$}F{\_}r{\$}, when MTI and MRI coexist, the magnetic field can be amplified by a factor of {\$}F{\_}t F{\_}r{\$}. We therefore conclude that MTI and MRI operate separately. The physical reason for the decouple of MTI and MRI is that they are two intrinsically different physical process. We also find that MTI helps to transfer angular momentum, because MTI can enhance the Maxwell stress (by amplifying the magnetic field) and Reynolds stress. Finally, we find that thermal conduction makes the temperature slope flatter by transporting energy outward. This makes the mass accretion rate smaller.},

We also use the method of stationary phase to construct a natural ansatz for a minimizer in the short wavelength limit.

Radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) are believed to $\backslash$npower supermassive black holes in the underluminous cores of galaxies.$\backslash$nSuch black holes are typically accompanied by flat-spectrum radio cores$\backslash$nindicating the presence of moderately relativistic jets. One of the best$\backslash$nconstrained RIAFs is associated with the supermassive black hole in the$\backslash$nGalactic center, Sgr A*. Aims: Since the plasma in RIAFs is only$\backslash$nweakly collisional, the dynamics and the radiative properties of these$\backslash$nsystems are very uncertain. Here we want to study the impact of varying$\backslash$nelectron temperature on the appearance of accretion flows and jets. Methods: Using three-dimensional general relativistic$\backslash$nmagnetohydrodynamics accretion flow simulations, we use ray tracing$\backslash$nmethods to predict spectra and radio images of RIAFs allowing for$\backslash$ndifferent electron heating mechanisms in the in- and outflowing parts of$\backslash$nthe simulations. Results: We find that small changes in the$\backslash$nelectron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relative$\backslash$ndominance of jets and accretion flows. Application to Sgr A* shows that$\backslash$nradio spectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a$\backslash$nmodel where electrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. The X-ray$\backslash$nemission is sensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and$\backslash$ndisk and therefore X-ray observations put strong constraints on electron$\backslash$ntemperatures and geometry of the accretion flow and jet. For Sgr A*, the$\backslash$njet model also predicts a significant frequency-dependent core shift$\backslash$nwhich could place independent constraints on the model once measured$\backslash$naccurately. Conclusions: We conclude that more sophisticated$\backslash$nmodels for electron distribution functions are crucial for constraining$\backslash$nGRMHD simulations with actual observations. For Sgr A*, the radio$\backslash$nappearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. Nonetheless,$\backslash$nat the highest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should$\backslash$nstill be detectable with future Very Long Baseline Interferometric$\backslash$nobservations.},

We then re-examine the question of transport efficiency through numerical simulations in the simplest setting of a local, unstrat-ified shearing box, with the help of a pseudo-spectral incompressible 3D code; viscosity and resistivity are explicitly accounted for. We focus on the effect of the dimensionless magnetic field strength, the Reynolds number and the magnetic Prandtl number. First, we complete existing investigations on the field strength dependence by showing that the transport in high magnetic pressure discs close to marginal stability is highly time dependent and surprisingly efficient. Secondly, we bring to light a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl number, with $\alpha$ ∝ Pm $\delta$ for the explored range: 0.12 {\textless} Pm {\textless} 8 and 200 {\textless} Re {\textless} 6400 ($\delta$ being in the range 0.25–0.5). We show that the dimensionless transport is not correlated to the dimensionless linear growth rate, contrary to a largely held expectation. For large enough Reynolds numbers, one would expect that the reported Prandtl number scaling of the transport should saturate, but such a saturation is out of reach of the present generation of supercomputers. Understanding this saturation process is nevertheless quite critical to ac-cretion disc transport theory, as the magnetic Prandtl number Pm is expected to vary by many orders of magnitude between the various classes of discs, from Pm 1 in young stellar object discs to Pm or 1 in active galactic nucleus discs. More generally, these results stress the need to control dissipation processes in astrophysical simulations.},

abstract = {Magnetic fields pervade the entire Universe and affect the formation and evolution of astrophysical systems from cosmological to plane-tary scales. The generation and dynamical amplification of extra-galactic magnetic fields through cosmic times, up to µGauss levels reported in nearby galaxy clusters, near equipartition with kinetic energy of plasma motions and on scales of at least tens of kilo-parsecs, is a major puzzle largely unconstrained by observations. A dynamo effect converting kinetic flow energy into magnetic energy is often invoked in that context, however extragalactic plasmas are weakly collisional (as opposed to magnetohydrodynamic fluids), and whether magnetic-field growth and sustainment through an efficient turbulent dynamo instability is possible in such plasmas is not estab-lished. Fully kinetic numerical simulations of the Vlasov equation in a six-dimensional phase space necessary to answer this question have until recently remained beyond computational capabilities. Here, we show by means of such simulations that magnetic-field amplifica-tion via a dynamo instability does occur in a stochastically-driven, non-relativistic subsonic flow of initially unmagnetized collisionless plasma. We also find that the dynamo self-accelerates and becomes entangled with kinetic instabilities as magnetization increases. The results suggest that such a plasma dynamo may be realizable in labo-ratory experiments, support the idea that intracluster medium (ICM) turbulence may have significantly contributed to the amplification of cluster magnetic fields up to near-equipartition levels on a timescale shorter than the Hubble time, and emphasize the crucial role of mul-tiscale kinetic physics in high-energy astrophysical plasmas. magnetic fields | dynamo | turbulence | intracluster medium},

abstract = {The half opening angle of a Kerr black hole shadow is always equal to (5±0.2)GM/Dc 2 , where M is the mass of the black hole and D is its distance from the Earth. Therefore, measuring the size of a shadow and verifying whether it is within this 4{\%} range constitutes a null hypothesis test of general relativity. We show that the black hole in the center of the Milky Way, SgrA * , is the optimal target for performing this test with upcoming observations using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We use the results of optical/IR monitoring of stellar orbits to show that the mass-to-distance ratio for SgrA * is already known to an accuracy of ∼4{\%}. We investigate our prior knowledge of the properties of the scattering screen between SgrA * and the Earth, the effects of which will need to be corrected for in order for the black hole shadow to appear sharp against the background emission. Finally, we explore an edge detection scheme for interferometric data and a pattern matching algorithm based on the Hough/Radon transform and demonstrate that the shadow of the black hole at 1.3 mm can be localized, in principle, to within ∼9{\%}. All these results suggest that our prior knowledge of the properties of the black hole, of scattering broadening, and of the accretion flow can only limit this general relativistic null hypothesis test with EHT observations of SgrA * to 10{\%}.},

We use a disk model that is local in the sense that it incorporates tidal and Coriolis forces but neglects background gradients in pressure and density. For simplicity we omit the vertical component of gravity and employ periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and azimuthal directions, and shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction. Our numerical method is an implementation of the "method of characteristics-constrained transport" algorithm. Most of the simulations begin with either a purely vertical or purely azimuthal magnetic field. Our major result is that turbulence is initiated and sustained by the magnetic instability. We provide a detailed characterization of the saturated turbulent state. The turbulence is anisotropic in a sense that implies an outward flux of angular momentum. The turbulent energy and angular momentum flux is dominated by magnetic stress rather than Reynolds stress. Most of the energy and angular momentum flux is concentrated at the largest scales. We find that the magnetic energy density in the saturated state is proportional to the product of the size of the simulation box and the initial field strength and is independent of the sound speed.},

abstract = {In weakly magnetized, dilute plasmas in which thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is important, the usual convective stability criterion is modified. Instead of depending on entropy gradients, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (@P/@z)(@ ln T/@z) {\textgreater} 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective instability that results in this regime as the magnetothermal instability (MTI).We use numerical MHD simulations that include anisotropic electron heat conduction to follow the growth and saturation of theMTI in two-dimensional, plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured in the simulations agree with the weak-field dispersion relation. We investigate the effect of strong fields and isotropic conduction on the linear properties and nonlinear regime of the MTI. In the nonlinear regime, the instability saturates and convection decays away when the atmosphere becomes isothermal. Sustained convective turbulence can be driven if there is a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom edges of the simulation domain, and if isotropic conduction is used to create convectively stable layers that prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. The largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions. These results have implications for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as the temperature profile of hot gas in galaxy clusters and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.

However, the promising generation of filaments at long distances for such purposes remains an issue. We propose a specially designed focusing telescope to properly deliver the laser pulses at long distance and generate powerful filaments. The telescope includes a deformable mirror (DM) that corrects the wavefront's aberrations working in a closed loop system with a wavefront sensor (WFS). Using this setup we are able to generate extraordinarily strong nitrogen signals at a distance as far as 90 m using 40 mJ laser pulses. Compared to the chirped based filament control technique, we believe that an appropriate control of the reservoir like what we have achieved will contribute to reduce the energy of the required laser pulses and at the same time, the cost of the required laser system. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that (1) the addition of the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array along with upgraded instrumentation in the 'Complete' stage of the EHT allow detection of the photon ring, a signature of Kerr strong gravity, for predicted values of its total flux; (2) the inclusion of co-herently averaged closure phases in our analysis dramatically improves the precision of even the current array, allowing (3) significantly tighter constraints on plausible accretion models and (4) detections of structural variability at the levels predicted by the models. While obser-vations at 345 GHz circumvent problems due to interstellar electron scattering in line of sight to the galactic centre, short baselines provided by CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) and/or the LMT could be required in order to constrain the overall shape of the accretion flow. Given the systematic uncertainties in the underlying models, using the full complement of two observing frequencies (230 and 345 GHz) and sources (Sgr A* and M87) may be critical for achieving transformative science with the EHT experiment.},

At present, lasers generating coherent bandwidths of several hundred nanometers have been demonstrated and correspondingly short pulses of 10 fs or so are quite usual. The limits to the breadth of optical spectra and brevity of pulse durations that may be achieved are often set by the dispersive properties of the linear optical elements of which the source is constructed. Progress in ultrafast optics to date has therefore relied extensively on the development of ways to characterize and manipulate dispersion. The means by which this can be accomplished are significantly different for laser oscillators and laser amplifiers, as well as for nonlinear interactions that are used to extend the range of frequencies at which short optical pulses are available, but in all cases it is this phenomenon that determines the output of current optical sources. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {By use of an imaging spectrometer we map the far-field (theta-lambda) spectra of 200-fs optical pulses that have undergone beam collapse and filamentation in a Kerr medium. By studying the evolution of the spectra with increasing input power and by using a model based on an asymptotic linear superposition of stationary wave modes (rather than the exact instantaneous solution), we are able to trace a consistent model of optical beam collapse highlighting the interplay between conical emission, multiple pulse splitting, and other effects such as spatial chirp.},

@article{Jin2015,
abstract = {We investigate the efficient generation of low-divergence high-order harmonics driven by waveform-optimized laser pulses in a gas-filled hollow waveguide. The drive waveform is obtained by synthesizing two-color laser pulses, optimized such that highest harmonic yields are emitted from each atom. Optimization of the gas pressure and waveguide configuration has enabled us to produce bright and spatially coherent harmonics extending from the extreme ultraviolet to soft x rays. Our study on the interplay among waveguide mode, atomic dispersion, and plasma effect uncovers how dynamic phase matching is accomplished and how an optimized waveform is maintained when optimal waveguide parameters (radius and length) and gas pressure are identified. Our analysis should help laboratory development in the generation of high-flux bright coherent soft x rays as tabletop light sources for applications.},

@article{Fragile2009,
abstract = {(Abridged) We present one of the first physically-motivated two-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical simulations of a radiatively-cooled black-hole accretion disk. The fiducial simulation combines a total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. By comparison with other simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows, radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without necessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. We further compare the results of our radiatively-cooled simulation to the predictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows. For the very low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk, we closely match a state called the "transition" solution between an outer advection-dominated accretion flow and what would be a magnetically-dominated accretion flow (MDAF) in the interior. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between the numerical and analytic models is quite good, with only a few well-understood exceptions. According to the analytic model then, at significantly higher stress or accretion, we would expect a full MDAF to form. The collection of simulations in this work also provide important data for interpreting other numerical results in the literature, as they span the most common treatments of thermodynamics, including simulations evolving: 1) the internal energy only; 2) the internal energy plus an explicit cooling function; 3) the total energy without cooling; and 4) total energy including cooling. We find that the total energy formulation is a necessary prerequisite for proper treatment of radiative cooling in MRI accretion flows.},
