\chapter{Modified Fluid Closure of a Collisionless Plasma}\label{chap:kinbrag}
This chapter puts together the pieces of the previous chapters in order to approximate a collisionless plasma with a modified fluid closure. 
\section{Anisotropic Viscosity}
Here, get a sense of what anisotropic viscosity does. This provides a control for the next section where the anisotropy will be capped.

\section{Pressure Anisotropy Maximum}
Following the suggestion by~\citet{Kunz2016}, we implement a maximum pressure anisotropy to mimic the mirror and firehose instabilities. Explained in Section~\ref{ssec:kinclosure}, we reproduce these thresholds here for completeness. The firehose instability threshold is given as
\begin{equation}
  p_\perp-p_\parallel<-B^2/4\pi
\end{equation}
and the mirror instability threshold is
\begin{equation}
  p_\perp-p_\parallel >B^2/8\pi \label{eq:mirrorthresh}
\end{equation}
