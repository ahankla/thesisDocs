\subsection{Linear Theory with the Boussinesq Approximation}\label{ssec:mriLinear}
The full general dispersion relation for the MRI can be derived straightfowardly by crunching the algebra and linearizing the MHD equations in Fourier space (see, for example,~\cite{BH1991a}). It is, however, more instructive to make an approximation that filters out the magnetosonic waves that are irrelevant in the regime of the MRI. This approximation, termed the ``Boussinesq Approximation'', effectively takes the sound speed to infinity. It manifests in the MHD equations by allowing us to drop pressure perturbations everywhere except the momentum equation, where they make sure the fluid is incompressible, and dropping density perturbations in the continuity equation, where they give buoyancy effects~\cite{KunzBoussNotes}.\\

Our equations are then:
