\section{Accretion Basics}
do this section and then the history? 
need to have this section to explain types of accretion flows 

\subsection{Types of Accretion Flows}
\subsubsection{Eddington Accretion Rate and Luminosity}
black holes vs others
\subsubsection{Scale Height}
THIN and THICK and HOT
\subsubsection{Other Types of Flows}

\subsection{Stability of Accreting Systems}
-Rayleigh criterion
