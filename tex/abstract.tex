  The diversity of plasmas in nature divides their study into many different regimes which are valid only within certain approximations. This paper attempts to extend the validity of one such regime (a fluids framework) to another (kinetic theory, for collisionless plasmas). The focus is more narrowly on astrophysical systems, where studies of collisionless plasmas very often use the fluid model which should theoretically not apply. Recent kinetic simulations of black hole accretion flows make radiatively inefficient accretion flows an ideal starting point to investigate the possibility of using a modified fluids closure to model collisionless plasmas. Study of these accretion flows is done through three-dimensional shearing box magnetohydrodynamic simulations with anisotropic viscosity and a maximum pressure anisotropy, a choice motivated by the aforementioned kinetic simulations. Results XXXXX and interesting because...(computation, conceptual, validate past work)
