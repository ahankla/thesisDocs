(what is accretion) When matter falls into black hole..
Accretion is efficient source of energy...would release XXX ergs of energy...so why don't we see this from black hole at center of galaxy? Such flows are called LLAGNs, ongoing theory. Typical calculations assume plasma is fluid model, But this type of accretion is hot, plasma is almost collisionless, so kinetic theory more appropriate. can we approximate the computationally-expensive kinetic theory with a fluid closure? We simulate using shearing box and find effective viscosity/resistivity....and find that [results]
