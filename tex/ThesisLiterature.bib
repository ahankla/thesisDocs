@article{Parrish2007,
abstract = {In many magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction occurs almost exclusively parallel to magnetic field lines. In this case, the usual stability criterion for convective stability, the Schwarzschild criterion, which depends on entropy gradients, is modified. In the magnetized long mean free path regime, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln T/dz) {\textgreater} 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective-type instability that results as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron heat conduction to numerically simulate the linear growth and nonlinear saturation of the MTI in plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent agreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition of isotropic conduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic fields can damp the growth of the MTI and affect the nonlinear regime. The instability saturates when the atmosphere becomes isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By maintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries of the simulation domain, sustained convective turbulence can be driven. MTI-stable layers introduced by isotropic conduction are used to prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. We find that the largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions as opposed to the actual thermal conduction itself. Finally, we explore the implications of this instability for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as neutron stars, the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.},

@article{Bu2016,
abstract = {Previous works have clearly shown the existence of winds from black hole hot accretion flow and investigated their detailed properties. In extremely low accretion rate systems, the collisional mean-free path of electrons is large compared with the length-scale of the system, thus thermal conduction is dynamically important. When the magnetic field is present, the thermal conduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines. In this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the wind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that thermal conduction has only moderate effects on the mass flux of wind. But the energy flux of wind can be increased by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} due to the increase of wind velocity when thermal conduction is included. The increase of wind velocity is because of the increase of driving forces (e.g. gas pressure gradient force and centrifugal force) when thermal conduction is included. This result demonstrates that thermal conduction plays an important role in determining the properties of wind.},

This amount of energy is ultimately distributed between outflow and radiation, the latter scaling weakly with the accretion rate for super-critical accretion rates, and returned to the interstellar medium.

However, the jet component is collimated and likely to interact only weakly with the environment, whereas the outflow and radiation components cover a wide solid angle.},

abstract = {Thermal conduction has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which sufficient extra heating is provided in radiation-dominated accretion flows. We consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to the viscosity and the energy transported by a saturated form of thermal conduction are balanced by the advection cooling. For the steady-state structure of such accretion flows a set of self-similar solution are presented. Based on these solutions while the radial and the rotational velocities are both sub-Keplerian, increasing the level of thermal conduction has the effects of decreasing the rotational velocity, but increasing the radial velocity. Conduction provides extra heating and the temperature of the gas increases with thermal conduction.},

@article{Fragile2009,
abstract = {(Abridged) We present one of the first physically-motivated two-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical simulations of a radiatively-cooled black-hole accretion disk. The fiducial simulation combines a total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. By comparison with other simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows, radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without necessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. We further compare the results of our radiatively-cooled simulation to the predictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows. For the very low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk, we closely match a state called the "transition" solution between an outer advection-dominated accretion flow and what would be a magnetically-dominated accretion flow (MDAF) in the interior. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between the numerical and analytic models is quite good, with only a few well-understood exceptions. According to the analytic model then, at significantly higher stress or accretion, we would expect a full MDAF to form. The collection of simulations in this work also provide important data for interpreting other numerical results in the literature, as they span the most common treatments of thermodynamics, including simulations evolving: 1) the internal energy only; 2) the internal energy plus an explicit cooling function; 3) the total energy without cooling; and 4) total energy including cooling. We find that the total energy formulation is a necessary prerequisite for proper treatment of radiative cooling in MRI accretion flows.},

abstract = {A weak-field local MHD instability that is of importance to accretion disks is examined. The maximum growth rate of the instability is found to be not only independent of the magnetic field strength but independent of field geometry as well. In particular, all Keplerian disks are unstable in the presence of any weak poloidal field, with the ratio of the maximum growth rate to disk angular velocity given by 3/4. The maximum growth rate of any weak field configuration that is not purely toroidal is given by the local Oort A-value of the disk. The behavior is studied by using a form of the dynamical Hill equations. It is conjectured that the Oort A-value is an upper bound to the growth rate of any instability feeding upon the free energy of differential rotation.},

Although the magnetorotational instability appears to be a promising process, poorly ionized regions of accretion discs may not undergo this instability. In this Letter, we revisit the possibility of transporting angular momentum by turbulent thermal convection. Using high-resolution spectral methods, we show that strongly turbulent convection can drive outward angular momentum transport at a rate that is, under certain conditions, compatible with observations of discs. We find, however, that the angular momentum transport is always much weaker than the vertical heat transport. These results indicate that convection might be another way to explain global disc evolution, provided that a sufficiently unstable vertical temperature profile can be maintained.},

abstract = {We introduce a new method for treating Comptonization in computational fluid dynamics. By construction, this method conserves the number of photons. Whereas the traditional "blackbody Comptonization" approach assumes that the radiation is locally a perfect blackbody and therefore uses a single parameter, the radiation temperature, to describe the radiation, the new "photon-conserving Comptonization" approach treats the photon gas as a Bose-Einstein fluid and keeps track of both the radiation temperature and the photon number density. We have implemented photon-conserving Comptonization in the general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL and we describe its impact on simulations of mildly super-critical black hole accretion disks. We find that blackbody Comptonization underestimates the gas and radiation temperature by up to a factor of two compared to photon-conserving Comptonization. This discrepancy could be serious when computing spectra. The photon-conserving simulation indicates that the spectral color correction factor of the escaping radiation in the funnel region of the disk could be as large as 5.},

abstract = {This review covers the main aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

The total pressure scale height in this disk is comparable to the vertical size of the initial torus. Gas pressure dominates near the equator; magnetic pressure is more important in the surrounding atmosphere. A magnetically dominated bound outflow is driven from the disk. The accretion rate through the disk exceeds the final rate into the hole, and a hot torus forms inside 10r(g). Hot gas, pushed up against the centrifugal barrier and confined by magnetic pressure, is ejected in a narrow, unbound, conical outflow. The dynamics are controlled by magnetic turbulence, not thermal convection, and a hydrodynamic alpha -model is inadequate to describe the flow.

@article{Balbus1998,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations of accretion flows that cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented. The calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thick torus with constant specific angular momentum. Accretion is induced by the addition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by a function nu. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of nu are varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial scales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by and a large fraction of the mass participating in the accretion flow. Although the instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective eddies, long-time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to certain steady-state solutions. The two-dimensional structure of the time-averaged flow is marginally stable to the H{\o}iland criterion, indicating that convection is efficient. Near the equatorial plane, the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power laws with an index that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. A stress in which nu{\~{}}r1/2 recovers the widely studied self-similar solution corresponding to an `alpha-disc'. We find that, regardless of the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear stress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied to the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate associated with the flow properties near the central object.},

abstract = {I calculate the linear stability of a stratified low collisionality plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Heat is assumed to flow only along magnetic field lines. In the absence of a heat flux in the background plasma, Balbus (2000) demonstrated that plasmas in which the temperature increases in the direction of gravity are buoyantly unstable to convective-like motions (the ``magnetothermal instability''). I show that in the presence of a background heat flux, an analogous instability is present when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity. The instability is driven by the background heat flux and the fastest growing mode has a growth time of order the local dynamical time. Thus, independent of the sign of the temperature gradient, weakly magnetized low collisionality plasmas are unstable on a dynamical time to magnetically-mediated buoyancy instabilities. The instability described in this paper is predicted to be present in clusters of galaxies at radii from {\~{}} 0.1-100 kpc, where the observed temperature increases outwards. Possible consequences for the origin of cluster magnetic fields, ``cooling flows,'' and the thermodynamics of the intercluster medium are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The stability of a dilute plasma to local convective and rotational disturbances is examined. A subthermal magnetic field and finite thermal conductivity along the field lines are included in the analysis. Stability criteria similar in form to the classical H{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}iland inequalities are found, but with angular velocity gradients replacing angular momentum gradients, and temperature gradients replacing entropy gradients. These criteria are indifferent to the properties of the magnetic field and to the magnitude of the thermal conductivity. Angular velocity gradients and temperature gradients are both free energy sources; it is not surprising that they are directly relevant to the stability of the gas. Magnetic fields and thermal conductivity provide the means by which these sources can be tapped. Previous studies have generally been based upon the classical H{\{}$\backslash$o{\}}iland criteria, which are inappropriate for magnetized, dilute astrophysical plasmas. In sharp contrast to recent claims in the literature, the new stability criteria demonstrate that marginal flow stability is not a fundamental property of accreting plasmas thought to be associated with low luminosity X-ray sources.},

abstract = {Aims. We study the influence of the choice of transport coefficients (viscosity and resistivity) on MHD turbulence driven by the mag-netorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks. Methods. We follow the methodology described in Paper I: we adopt an unstratified shearing box model and focus on the case where the net vertical magnetic flux threading the box vanishes. For the most part we use the operator split code ZEUS, including explicit transport coefficients in the calculations. However, we also compare our results with those obtained using other algorithms (NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate both the convergence of our results and their independence of the numerical scheme. Results. We find that small scale dissipation affects the saturated state of MHD turbulence. In agreement with recent similar numer-ical simulations done in the presence of a net vertical magnetic flux, we find that turbulent activity (measured by the rate of angular momentum transport) is an increasing function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm for all values of the Reynolds number Re that we investigated. We also found that turbulence disappears when the Prandtl number falls below a critical value Pm c that is apparently a decreasing function of Re. For the limited region of parameter space that can be probed with current computational resources, we always obtained Pm c {\textgreater} 1. Conclusions. We conclude that the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are important in determining the properties of MHD tur-bulence in numerical simulations in the shearing box with zero net flux, at least for Reynolds numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers that are such that transport is not dominated by numerical effects and thus can be probed using current computational resources.},

As a result of the MTI, we find that the temperature profile of the ICM can be substantially modified on timescales of several billion years, while the magnetic field is amplified by dynamo action up to more than 50 times the original energy.

@article{Stone1996,
abstract = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (Balbus {\&} Hawley 1991) in an initially isothermal, vertically stratified accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk, but are global in the vertical direction in the sense that the computational domain encompasses several scale heights. We find that the instability generates and maintains magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stratified disks. The properties of the saturated, turbulent state are similar to those reported for nonstratified homogeneous boxes, e.g., the power-law spectral distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov. The angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the magnetic pressure; if the average rate is scaled to the equatorial pressure, as in a standard ''alpha-disk'' model, the constant of proportionality is alpha less than or similar to 0.01 for most of our simulations. This value may be limited somewhat by the numerical resolution of our simulations. We find buoyancy does not play an important role as a saturation mechanism. The nonlinear evolution of disks that begin with a variety of initial magnetic field geometries and strengths is similar. In particular, models in which the most unstable wavelengths are initially well resolved saturate at and maintain roughly the same magnetic energy density, suggesting dynamo action in the disk.We use the simulations to study the effect of the instability on the vertical structure of magnetic accretion disks. After saturation, the disk consists of a weakly magnetized core surrounded by a strongly magnetized corona. Changing the vertical boundary conditions does not significantly alter this structure. The vertical flux of magnetic energy is small compared to the local magnetic energy generation and dissipation rates; The disk is stable to Parker and buoyancy modes. Models evolved with an adiabatic equation of state undergo substantial heating due to nonlinear dissipation, resulting in an increase in the scale height of the disk. The vertical structure produced by the instability, particularly the presence of a strongly magnetized corona, may have relevance to the production of MHD winds from disks.},

abstract = {Using long-duration general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion discs, the energy, momentum and mass outflow rates from such systems are estimated. Outflows occur via two fairly distinct modes: a relativistic jet and a sub-relativistic wind. The jet power depends strongly on the black hole spin and on the magnetic flux at the horizon. Unless these are very small, the energy output in the jet dominates over that in the wind. For a rapidly spinning black hole accreting in the magnetically arrested limit, it is confirmed that jet power exceeds the total rate of accretion of rest mass energy. However, because of strong collimation, the jet probably does not have a significant feedback effect on its immediate surroundings. The power in the wind is more modest and shows a weaker dependence on black hole spin and magnetic flux. Nevertheless, because the wind subtends a large solid angle, it is expected to provide efficient feedback on a wide range of scales inside the host galaxy. Empirical formulae are obtained for the energy and momentum outflow rates in the jet and the wind.},

Such effects lower the growth rates found in the absence of such tension but still allow growth rates in excess of the maximum of the standard magnetorotational instability.

Instead of depending on entropy gradients, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (@P/@z)(@ ln T/@z) {\textgreater} 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the convective instability that results in this regime as the magnetothermal instability (MTI).We use numerical MHD simulations that include anisotropic electron heat conduction to follow the growth and saturation of theMTI in two-dimensional, plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured in the simulations agree with the weak-field dispersion relation. We investigate the effect of strong fields and isotropic conduction on the linear properties and nonlinear regime of the MTI. In the nonlinear regime, the instability saturates and convection decays away when the atmosphere becomes isothermal. Sustained convective turbulence can be driven if there is a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom edges of the simulation domain, and if isotropic conduction is used to create convectively stable layers that prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. The largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions. These results have implications for a variety of astrophysical systems, such as the temperature profile of hot gas in galaxy clusters and the structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.

abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of magnetorotational instability in a local patch of accretion disk in which radiation pressure exceeds gas pressure. Such conditions may occur in the central regions of disks surrounding compact objects in active galactic nuclei and Galactic X-ray sources. We assume axisymmetry and neglect vertical stratification. The growth rates of the instability on initially uniform magnetic fields are consistent with the linear analysis of Blaes {\&} Socrates (2001). As is the case when radiation effects are neglected, the nonlinear development of the instability leads to transitory turbulence when the initial magnetic field has no net vertical flux. During the turbulent phase, angular momentum is transported outward. The Maxwell stress is a few times the Reynolds stress, and their sum is about 4 times the mean pressure in the vertical component of the magnetic field. For magnetic pressure exceeding gas pressure, turbulent fluctuations in the field produce density contrasts about equal to the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure. These are many times larger than in the corresponding gas pressure-dominated situation and may have profound implications for the steady state vertical structure of radiation-dominated disks. Diffusion of radiation from compressed regions damps turbulent motions, converting kinetic energy into photon energy.},

abstract = {We study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on magnetized spherical accretion flows using global axisymmetric MHD simulations. In low collisionality plasmas, the Bondi spherical accretion solution is unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI). The MTI grows rapidly at large radii where the inflow is subsonic. For a weak initial field, the MTI saturates by creating a primarily radial magnetic field, i.e., by aligning the field lines with the background temperature gradient. The saturation is quasilinear in the sense that the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim 10-30{\$} independent of the initial field strength (for weak fields). In the saturated state, the conductive heat flux is much larger than the convective heat flux, and is comparable to the field-free (Spitzer) value (since the field lines are largely radial). The MTI by itself does not appreciably change the accretion rate {\$}\backslashdot M{\$} relative to the Bondi rate {\$}\backslashdot M{\_}B{\$}. However, the radial field lines created by the MTI are amplified by flux freezing as the plasma flows in to small radii. Oppositely directed field lines are brought together by the converging inflow, leading to significant resistive heating. When the magnetic energy density is comparable to the gravitational potential energy density, the plasma is heated to roughly the virial temperature; the mean inflow is highly subsonic; most of the energy released by accretion is transported to large radii by thermal conduction; and the accretion rate {\$}\backslashdot M \backslashll \backslashdot M{\_}B{\$}. The predominantly radial magnetic field created by the MTI at large radii in spherical accretion flows may account for the stable Faraday rotation measure towards Sgr A* in the Galactic Center.},

abstract = {Black holes accreting well below the Eddington rate are believed to have geometrically thick, optically thin, rotationally supported accretion discs in which the Coulomb mean free path is large compared to {\$}GM/c{\^{}}2{\$}. In such an environment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal magnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric simulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The simulations are carried out using a new code {\$}{\{}\backslashrm\backslashit grim{\}}{\$}, which evolves a covariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal effects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are modeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference between the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model relies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering and velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the pressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it saturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces outward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD turbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the wall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations, conduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux is constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to perpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an increase in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability.},

abstract = {Context. Accretion onto galactic and supermassive black holes occurs in different modes, which are documented in hard and soft spectral states, commonly attributed to an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) inside a truncated disk and standard disk accretion, respectively. At the times of spectral transition an intermediate state is observed, for which the accretion flow pattern is still unclear. Aims. We analyze the geometry of the accretion flow when the mass flow rate in the disk decreases (soft/hard transition) and evapo-ration of gas into the coronal flow leads to disk truncation. Methods. We evaluate the physics of an advection-dominated flow affected by thermal conduction to a cool accretion disk underneath. Results. We find re-condensation of gas from the ADAF into the underlying inner disk at distances from the black hole and at rates, that depend on the properties of the hot ADAF and vary with the mass accretion rate. This sustains an inner disk for longer than a viscous decay time after the spectral transition occurred, in accordance with the spectra that indicate cool gas in the neighborhood of the accreting black hole. The model allows us to understand why Cyg X-1 does not show hysteresis in the spectral state transition luminosity that is commonly observed for X-ray transient sources. Conclusions. Our results shed new light on the complex mass flow pattern during spectral state transition.},

We extend and confirm the previous works of $\backslash$citet{\{}2009MNRAS.400..820T{\}} and $\backslash$citet{\{}2010A{\&}A...512A..82M{\}} by scanning a large parameter range for the disk magnetization, {\$}\backslashmu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm D{\}} = 10{\^{}}{\{}-3.5{\}} ... 10{\^{}}{\{}-0.7{\}}{\$}. We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the outflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We show how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to the disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual findings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations from time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the disk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the local disk magnetization and (i)the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass loading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate. Essentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and faster jets, and, due to a larger Alfv$\backslash$'en lever arm, these jets extract more angular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have, however, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass ejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where the magnetization is {\$}\backslashmu(r,z) \backslashsimeq 0.1{\$}. The magnetization rapidly increases vertically providing the energy reservoir for subsequent jet acceleration. We find indication for a critical disk magnetization {\$}\backslashmu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm D{\}} \backslashsimeq 0.01{\$} that separates the regimes of magnetocentrifugally-driven and magnetic pressure-driven jets.},

We also demonstrate that the resulting two-zone ADIOS models are not dynamically self-consistent without the introduction of an energy source close in to the central regions of the flow; we identify this with the energy liberated by accretion. We explore the parameter space of non-radiative models and show that both powerful winds and gentle breezes are possible. When small radiative losses (with fixed efficiency) are included, any centrally injected energy flux is radiated away and the system reverts to a power-law behavior with n {\textless} 1, where n falls in a small range determined by the fractional level of radiative losses. We also present an ADIOS model for hypercritical (super-Eddington) disk accretion, in which the radiative losses are closely related to the flow geometry. We suggest that hyperaccretion can lead to either winds or breezes.},

For simplicity we omit the vertical component of gravity and employ periodic boundary conditions in the vertical and azimuthal directions, and shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the radial direction. Our numerical method is an implementation of the "method of characteristics-constrained transport" algorithm. Most of the simulations begin with either a purely vertical or purely azimuthal magnetic field. Our major result is that turbulence is initiated and sustained by the magnetic instability. We provide a detailed characterization of the saturated turbulent state. The turbulence is anisotropic in a sense that implies an outward flux of angular momentum. The turbulent energy and angular momentum flux is dominated by magnetic stress rather than Reynolds stress. Most of the energy and angular momentum flux is concentrated at the largest scales. We find that the magnetic energy density in the saturated state is proportional to the product of the size of the simulation box and the initial field strength and is independent of the sound speed.},

It was suggested that these energy bands are dominated by the jet emission; however, this scenario does not work in a number of cases. We propose here an alternative, namely that most of the OIR emission is produced by the extended hot accretion flow. In this scenario, the OIR bands are dominated by the synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons. An additional contribution is expected from the outer irradiated part of the accretion disc heated by the X-rays. We discuss the properties of the model and compare them to the data. We show that the hot-flow scenario is consistent with many of the observed spectral data, at the same time naturally explaining X-ray timing properties, fast OIR variability and its correlation with the X-rays.},

abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher-order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume-averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area-averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally-split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally-unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and Fortran95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods. The source code is freely available for download on the web.},

abstract = {We carried out three-dimensional global resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability in optically thin hot black hole accretion flows by assuming bremsstrahlung cooling. General relativistic effects are simulated by using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. Cooling instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes sufficiently large. We found that as the instability grows the accretion flow changes from an optically thin, hot, gas pressure-supported state (low/hard state) to a cooler, magnetically supported, quasi-steady state. During this transition, magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure because the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the toroidal magnetic flux. Since further vertical contraction of the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically supported disk, the heating rate balances with the radiative cooling rate. The magnetically supported disk exists for time scale much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to the accretion time scale. We examined the stability of the magnetically supported disk analytically, assuming that the toroidal magnetic flux is conserved, and found it thermally and secularly stable. Our findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous, X-ray hard state even when their luminosity exceeds the threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.},

@article{Done2007,
abstract = {We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet. Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as higher frequencies (including quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs) in the power spectra, and a faster jet. The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative (and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard soft spectral transition seen in black holes. The neutron stars are also consistent with the same models, but with an additional component due to their surface, giving implicit evidence for the event horizon in black holes. We review claims of observational data which conflict with this picture, but show that these can also be consistent with the truncated disc model. We also review suggested alternative models for the accretion flow which do not involve a truncated disc. The most successful of these converge on a similar geometry, where there is a transition at some radius larger than the last stable orbit between a standard disc and an inner, jet dominated region, with the X-ray source associated with a mildly relativistic outflow, beamed away from the disc. However, the observed uniformity of properties between black holes at different inclinations suggests that even weak beaming of the X-ray emission may be constrained by the data. After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the black hole spin. By contrast, these systems can also show very different spectra at these high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum (and probably structure) is strongly distorted by Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity, though there is growing evidence that winds may play an important role. We stress that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert 1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.},

@article{Balbus2000,
abstract = {The stratiÐcation of entropy and the stratiÐcation of angular momentum are closely analogous. The analogy has been developed for a number of di†erent problems in the {\~{N}}uid literature, but its conse- quences for the behavior of turbulent accretion disks are less appreciated. Of particular interest is the behavior of disks in which angular momentum transport is controlled by convection, and heat transport by dynamical turbulence. In both instances we argue that the transport must proceed ““ backward {\"{I}}{\"{I}} rela- tive to the sense one would expect from a simple enhanced di†usion approach. Reversed angular momentum transport has already been seen in numerical simulations ; contragradient thermal di†usion should be amenable to numerical veriÐcation as well. These arguments also bear on the observed nonlin- ear local stability of isolated Keplerian disks : locally generated turbulence in such a disk would require simultaneous inward and outward angular momentum transport, which is, of course, impossible. We also describe a di†usive instability that is the entropy analogue to the magnetorotational instability. It a†ects thermally stratiÐed layers when Coulomb conduction and a weak magnetic Ðeld are present. The plasma must be sufficiently dilute that heat is channeled only along Ðeld lines. The criterion for convective insta- bility goes from one of upwardly decreasing entropy to one of upwardly decreasing temperature. The instability remains formally viable if radiative heat transport is also present, but the equilibrium is much more unstable if Coulomb transport is dominant. In that case, the maximum growth rate is of the order of the inverse sound crossing time, independent of the thermal conductivity. The indi†erence of the growth rate to the conduction coefficient, its simple dynamical scaling, and the replacement in the stabil- ity criterion of a conserved quantity (entropy) gradient by a free energy (temperature) gradient are properties similar to those exhibited by the magnetorotational instability.},

abstract = {For magnetized accretion flows with very low accretion rates such as that in the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center, {\$}Sgr A{\^{}}*{\$}, the mean free path of electrons is much greater than the Larmor radius and is an appreciable fraction of the size of the system. In this case, the thermal conduction is anisotropic and dynamically important. Provided that the magnetic field is weak, magnetothermal instability (MTI) exists . It can amplify the magnetic field and align the field lines with the temperature gradient (i.e., the radial direction). If the accretion flow is differentially rotating, magnetorotational instability (MRI) also exists as well known. In this paper, we investigate the possible interaction of these two instabilities. We study a hot accretion flow around Bondi radius, where the infall timescale of gas is longer than the MTI and MRI growth timescales, thus MTI and MRI coexist. We focus on the interaction between MTI and MRI by examining the magnetic field amplification induced by the two instabilities. We find that MTI and MRI mainly amplify the radial and toroidal components of the magnetic field, respectively. Most importantly, we find that if MTI alone can amplify the magnetic field by a factor of {\$}F{\_}t{\$} and MRI alone by a factor of {\$}F{\_}r{\$}, when MTI and MRI coexist, the magnetic field can be amplified by a factor of {\$}F{\_}t F{\_}r{\$}. We therefore conclude that MTI and MRI operate separately. The physical reason for the decouple of MTI and MRI is that they are two intrinsically different physical process. We also find that MTI helps to transfer angular momentum, because MTI can enhance the Maxwell stress (by amplifying the magnetic field) and Reynolds stress. Finally, we find that thermal conduction makes the temperature slope flatter by transporting energy outward. This makes the mass accretion rate smaller.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the mechanism for state transitions in black hole X-ray binary disks, we have proposed a series of local shearing box simulations. These simulations will systematically examine the impact of various physical effects on the MRI-driven angular momentum transport in these disks. In particular, nonzero viscosity and resistivity and their ratio, the magnetic Prandtl number, have been shown to have a strong effect on the angular momentum transport. Previous studies have focused on a limited set of initial conditions. We expand on these initial conditions in this paper in order to gain a deeper understanding of exactly how viscosity and resistivity affect the accretion flow. We find that for a purely azimuthal magnetic field configuration, which is more applicable to real accretion disks, the angular momentum transport depends strongly on the resistivity, but is nearly independent of the viscosity. This work serves as an essential stepping stone to constructing simulations where the viscosity and resistivity are temperature-dependent and are thus controlled by turbulent heating, radiative cooling, and vertical gravity.},

abstract = {These lecture notes and example problems are based on a course given at the University of Cambridge in Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena, such as the formation and internal dynamics of stars and giant planets, the workings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes and the dynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in astrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the dynamical influence of the magnetic field that is ‘frozen in' to a highly conducting plasma. The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The mathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated conservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for both analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other discontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be solved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal the physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as their stability and their response to tidal forcing.},
