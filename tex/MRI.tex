\section{MRI Basics}
The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a linear instability of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations that leads to increased outward angular momentum transport, hence providing the driving mechanism for accretion. In section~\ref{ssec:mriDeriv} the linear analysis itself will be provided; section~\ref{ssec:mriSpring} will discuss a more physical picture.


\subsection{MRI Derivation}\label{ssec:mriDeriv}
The MRI arises out of a simple linear analysis of the ideal MHD equations as outlined in section~\ref{ssec:mhdDeriv}.
